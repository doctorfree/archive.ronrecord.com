<B>Love Like an Enemy</B><P></FONT>


<FONT SIZE=4>


<B>I</B> dreamed I fell in love with my teacher. She was left-handed, 
like all the geniuses I've known. I loved to sit in her office with nine 
dark windows and pretend we were the same person.<P>
	She trained me to baby-talk in a once-dead language that made 
me see her face was very beautiful. I'd watch her soft lips as I 
disclosed myself in a trance, trying to remember the big sin of 
childhood she said had not yet completely decayed in me. Her eyes 
were sometimes grey and sometimes invisible. Her sweat made me 
nervous. I wanted to believe she was smarter than me, that she'd 
find virginal songs in me that I wasn't allowed to discover myself.<P>
	For once in my life, thanks to her dangerous listening, I felt I 
could tell the truth. I told her about mopping the floors of scummy 
nightclubs in North Carolina with my old right-handed wife, back 
before I knew how much my body was really worth. I joked about my 
career as the wrong-way healer. I confessed my sarcastic visions 
about the "democracy of proud voyeurs," and bragged about how much 
pain I'd learned from my chaotic father figures.<P>
	She believed my fantasies were real; I didn't have to pretend 
they were symbols or disguises. I told her how I'd practiced alchemy 
as a lesbian sufi baseball player for the Detroit Sphinxes in the 
Middle Ages. I showed her how to play <I>Naked in Hell</I>, a game I learned in 
childhood from two loving medusas who taught me not to be afraid of strong 
women.<P>
 <BR>
<P>	<B>A</B>nd then one morning she smelled like a thousand lotuses; one 
afternoon she had sharp fingers on her hands and looked at me from 
high above; one night she told me that I was too beautiful and loud 
and that I didn't laugh right.<P>
	That night I dreamed she was a delicious young priestess 
singing to me from a kitchen below the equator. Somewhere in 
Samoa, maybe, or a lagoon called Soma. <I>No man is an island, but 
many are atolls,</I> her voice fermented as it tunneled to me under the 
nightsea like a black river. I listened hard, trying to feel her 
menstruation in my body for the first time.<P>
	 <I>Fantastically Tame Criminal Performing The Grimace</I> was the first title 
she gave me, then <I>Imagination Fat</I>, and then <I>Modern Singing Indian 
Addicted To Electricity Generated From Trivial Wastes</I>. Her mermaid's sound 
ripped like a lawyer's. I felt I was her experiment alone, her story, and 
she was giving me the long-lost names of my ridiculous powers.<P>
<BR>
 <P>	<B>T</B>his was my total collapse into her life of constant medicine. 
The agony was perfect--a gift that was stronger than love. It 
required me to believe that I was not myself, but the dream of a 
magical animal in the advanced stages of putrefaction, very close to 
being born again in an immortal body. I felt I'd lost all my debts, had 
no more need to learn, had been initiated into a sanctuary of 
deathless longing--longing with no need for satisfaction or 
frustration.<P>
	A fish light from my eyes came alive, and I felt myself 
slipping out into her black river. <I>I drink you black river,</I> I sang 
without drowning. This was before sun or moon, before white 
furnaces called stars pulsed at all, before personalities or climaxes. 
The bestial stinging water hissed in my broken mouth, tasting of 
drowned worms and rotting pearl. I was a red string of muscle 
swelling all the way to that kitchen where she spread out a million 
humming bloody muds for my arrival, soaked me up and then exploded 
me into her autumn tornado full of menses and shattered doors and 
burning furniture.<P>
	In the last memory before I died, I saw the book she wrote 
about my life. It said that I laughed wrong and wasted my 
imagination until the end of time--but that I was a better lover than 
even the very slippery, very smart white wolf she had allowed to 
worship her once.<P>
<BR>
<P>	<B>A</B>fter that I tried to fascinate her with suffering I imagined 
she'd never seen before. I became a famous singer with 
claustrophobic eyes, smashing myself against the cruel plates of 
food she wanted to watch me eat. I cut my left arm with a knife 
every time I used the words "be" or "am" in her presence. I torched 
all letters I'd ever received from my admirers, planted the ashes 
like a seed, then hid in her closet and watched her all night without 
hatred. I decided to desire her as strongly as if she were the exactly 
wrong woman for me to love.<P>
<BR>
<P>	<B>O</B>ne night she danced the spiral slam dance for me. I laid down 
and adored her as if I would never know again whether I was really a 
good person or a bad person. Then there was indigo again, indigo the 
killer, indigo the rejuvenator, and I pulsed until I thought I was food 
myself and would be eaten like a god. The way we moved was like 
one fish digesting itself. I'd never been so forgotten, so 
unmystifying, so unhealable.<P>
	When I woke up for the second time there were no lights, no 
eyes, only her stories about me. She said then that this was the 
scariest night of my life because she was turning my body into my 
soul and when she was finished I would no longer be famous with 
anyone but God. <P>
