Perhaps even you have screwed up your courage, invented a fake job title that sounds much more highly-paid than your own, shaved 20 pounds and added four inches to your profile, and have exuberantly blathered into a stranger's voicemail that you adore snow camping, would never ever <I>ever</I> smoke, only drink at wedding toasts, and haven't inhaled anything except Ventolin since Lennon died. Yeah, that sounds like you. <P>
Sounds like most of us.<P>
Well, it's time to fess up the true stuff, the good stuff, the <I>real</I> stuff about who you are--in four lines or less. And Grand Master Rob is here to help you, as this month he unveils with a flourish his own particular brand of funky tantric pagan <A HREF="sex-friends-oct.html">personal ads</A> for the very sane.<P>
Use 'em, steal 'em, plagiarize the heck out of 'em. We're inviting you to. And then, as with all of the fresh hot steaming copy we're serving up in this newsletter, <A HREF="mailto:zenpride@realastrology.com">write in</A> and tell us what happened, what you wore, what s/he said--in short: give us the late-night roommate report.<P>
We're waiting up.<P>
