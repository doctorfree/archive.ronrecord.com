Rule number one at the Broken Hearts Club is that blurting your tale of woe out to a rapidly disinterested stranger at a bar is not a very good idea. The BHC<FONT SIZE=3><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT> additionally advises that letting first-date salmon cool whilst telling your increasingly horrified datee about the vagaries and bathing habits of your former love is also <I>not</I> a very good idea. And finally, the BHC<FONT SIZE=3><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>  wishes to remind you that scratching your name with a key into the hood of the former loved one's new Jaguar is the <I>worst</I> idea of all--especially if you're still paying the insurance on the damn thing.<P>
We here at BHC<FONT SIZE=3><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT>  headquarters instead advocate <A HREF="mailto:zenpride@realastrology.com">a pure and total gut-spilling</A>. A purge, if you will, of the bilge and silt that builds up when the dam gates of a heart are broken. A one-shot bulimic vent of all of that sadness and sorrow you so greedily ate up when your former became latter. <P>
No need to sit around in an uncomfortable circle, perched on a plastic chair with a cup of vending machine coffee in one scalded hand and a dying plant harboring the community room's corner while a perky professional who has clearly never had more of life's distress than a pimple on prom night encourages you to "share." Hell with that.<P>
<A HREF="mailto:zenpride@realastrology.com">Gut it out to us</A>, just as you are, whether sitting in filthy underwear in an untidy room with one crooked Kurt Cobain poster on the wall as your only decoration or fancily suited with a lonely Versace mouse adorning your computer. Man-oh-man, have we been there too.<P>
