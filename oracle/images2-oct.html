<B>WE DON'T WRITE POEMS</B><P></FONT>



<FONT SIZE=4>


There was no naked Jungian dreamworker breaking our  
piano with her high-heeled shoe when we got home, friends;  
there was never a naked Jungian dreamworker.<P>
There were no bums in dirty yellow pants crawling over  
us when we made love to Magda the doll-maker on the moldy  
clothes beneath the Goodwill trailer. <P>
We made it all up. We were just kidding. We were just 
faking.  We were just trying to get attention.<P>
There was no son of an Irish diplomat coming after us  
when we stole his neglected girlfriend, and he did not pound  
us with pots from our own kitchen as he cursed us with Dylan  
Thomas poems in the middle of the winter night.<P>
We were not famous. We did not encourage our admirers  
to have sex in public. There were no gorgeous Catholic crones  
humping the home-made crucifix when we woke in the bright  
August afternoon.<P>
We never went home with the Russian translator of  
Gogol and finger-painted her white wall to match the maps of  
the solar system that we used to love to draw as children. We  
never put her underpants on our heads and sang Rimbaud songs  
in her mouth until she cried a thousand years of joy.<P>
She wanted us to but we didn't.<P>
There were never any magic housewives our own age  
trying to convince us that we would someday be mayors and  
shamans and environmentalists. They did not tell us to wise  
up and control our cocks better, and they did not make fun of  
our poems.<P>
The truth is, we were already mayors and shamans and  
environmentalists in our dreams, we controlled our cocks  
better because we were tired of fucking too many different  
women who were too good for us, and we did not write poems.<P>

But the main thing is, we did <I>not</I> let Liz Beth piss  
down on us through her red lam&eacute; pants from the top of the oak  
tree in the parking lot behind the Catalyst bar. There was no  
gentle hot stream falling down through the mist on our hands  
and faces.<P>
We did not get turned on; we did not crawl around the  
tree yapping and barking. There was no beautiful young  
nursing mother who was crazier than us.
