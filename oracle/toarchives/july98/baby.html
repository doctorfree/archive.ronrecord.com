Darned right you are, and it's high time that you began treating yourself that way. That's why we at the Real Astrology Institute of Functional Self-Love and Compassion have named Wednesday, July 15, as Be Your Own Baby Day.<P>
Forget that onerous and necessary diaper thing. Be Your Own Baby Day is about treating yourself as though your toes deserved to be kissed, your smiles photographed, your peas pur&eacute;ed. Your tummy is made to be blown into until one of those funny farty sounds is made; your hair <I>should</I> be washed with gentle shampoos; your neck was made to be cradled, your nails to be delicately bitten off. <P>
This is one day a year when each and everyone of us bestows upon him- or herself the sweet tender love that outrageously doting and intelligent parents naturally give to a six-month-old. If hypnosis and fading photos prove that you were the recipient of such unconditional love when new, congratulations--do it again now that you're not so new. If your parents were distracted or flawed, now is the time to make it up to yourself. <P>
It doesn't take much. <P>
Babies adore being spoken to of their perfection in lilting voices--tell yourself how wonderful you are in the rising crescendo of a happy mother. Babies go crazy for the smell of fresh lemons, the taste of a peach, and the silk of a tulip petal. Treat yourself to those little ordinary miracles. <P>
Babies like to be there for a stroll through the park, a whizz on a bike, a hike up a trail. Unstrap yourself and stroll/whizz/hike. Babies love full body rubs, being held tightly, warm baths, songs, and bedtime stories. So do you.<P>
Take the day off--nothing much gets done on a Wednesday, anyway. Then <A HREF="mailto:zenpride@realastrology.com">let us know</A> how you spent this one, short, 24-hour period, taken out of 364 other days of outrageous maturity, being your own baby. We'll tell you how we spent ours.<P>
