The Broken Hearts Club is the first conspiracy you've ever heard of that says a broken heart can be a good thing, that hearts were made to be broken, that if you're really listening to the music of the world your heart breaks a hundred times a day. The Broken Hearts Club is now open for membership to all you lovers who've made yourselves brave enough and sensitive enough and passionate enough to risk the possibility that at any moment your hearts might be shattered, ripped apart, scattered in a million fragments.<P>
Break your heart again <A HREF="mailto:zenpride@realastrology.com">by telling us about it</A>. How did it rend in the first place, what have you learned, or why are you willing to shatter it all over again?<P><BR><P>

The spot is just up on the high tender of my neck, near the back of the ear, below the unsunned space where the dye doesn't reach and my hair is brown. In the early days of the new house with the large garden and the good jazz and the red wine and the dinners outside, he would lift my hair to kiss me just there, on that spot. Sometimes I would twist the hair up so that the spot could be kissed more readily. I knew that the change had come, could feel the first cracks burning toward the break, when I lifted my heavy mane to bare the spot and he turned away. And turned away and turned away and turned away until the jazz didn't sound so good and all that was left of the red wine was what he forgot of the sullen sediment woozing around the bottom of the bottle.</FONT></UL>
