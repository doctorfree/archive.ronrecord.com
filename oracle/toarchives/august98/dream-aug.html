This is a dream. This is just a dream. It is not intended as an attack on the NBA's former wonderman.<P>

Last night I dreamed that Magic Johnson broke my arm with a wooden mallet. My arm had to be broken in order for a sickly-looking potted sunflower to bloom. <P>
Anyway the deal was, I was going to let Magic Johnson (wearing tailored suit and capped-tooth smile &aacute; la "<A HREF="http://www.themagichour.com/index.asp">The Magic Hour</A>") crack my forearm with the understanding that someone would immediately set the broken bones and supply me with premium pharmaceuticals. <P>
WHACK! My arm is broken. The plant still looks like shit. And Magic Johnson is sitting on his ass in front of the TV and I'm walking around with a compound fracture of the radius and ulna.<P>
"Aren't you going to set my arm?" I ask, starting to get annoyed.<P>
Magic looks up from the boob-tube and answers, "You know, you could be a really pretty girl if you would just learn to stand up straight."<P>
Obviously, I'm a Virgo.

What happens when you sail into the Land of Nod? <A HREF="mailto:zenpride@realastrology.com">Send us</A> the poems, specters, ghosts, jokes, itches, and moments of pleasure that insinuate themselves from that worm hole that stretches from the dumb-days of consciousness into the wild free green grasses and outrageously salty peppermint forests of the dreaming mind. We'll slather it around.<P>
