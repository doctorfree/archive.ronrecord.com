A five-week July is almost enough time to wallow in the grain-scented splendours of summer, and to savor the voyueristic pleasure of reading your smart thoughts, wit, and contributions to the first Televisionary Oracle newsletter. It was also enough time to quit the Real Astrology's pig farm nerve center and laundry room to take two circuits through <A HREF="saint-aug.html">Sir Stanley Spencer's</A> exhibit in San Francisco, commiserate with your <A HREF="sin-aug.html">sins</A>, and to print out and burn a <A HREF="menstrual.html">menstrual rant</A> with some dried rosemary and silky geranium clippings.<P>
We're still reeling from the success of last month's <A HREF="toarchives/july98/baby.html">Be Your Own Baby Day</A>, that happy Wednesday devoted to nothing but taking care of yourself as the best parent would. Readers wrote in to report a lie-about adventure on a Venezuelan beach; the new worlds revealed by a spin in a dump truck taken while playing hookey from work; the joy of spending a sick day at home eating nothing but apple sauce between bouts of massage therapy and hot-tubbing; and the pleaure in a slow, zen-like piecing together of the type of mobile that--if it doesn't make babies smarter--certainly gives them plenty of toe-time while lying placidly on their backs. <P>
We celebrated wildly by eating a soft mango with a very small spoon, splurging on a long bike ride, and re-reading Dr. Spock. Rob achieved a personal best by sleeping until 4 p.m. and adding deeply to a dream journal. Only an ill-advised attempt to bathe in the kitchen sink proved unpleasurable. Look for this month's blow-out, <A HREF="boring.html">Dare to Be Boring Day</A>, to provide relief from the rigors of sparkling conversation on Wednesday, Aug. 19.<P>
Also, thanks to all of those studious Cancers who sharpened their No. 2 pencils, opened their blue books, and took the <A HREF="../../../allsigns/070298gfx.html#CANCER">Mid-Term exam</A>. Each test has been stringently graded, the bell curve has chimed, and Rob is pleased to announce that you have all been promoted, though some of you did neglect to answer the bonus question of how many Funky Grail members can dance the Samba on the head of a love doll. . . . <P>
Check out reader <A HREF="tiger.html">L.J. Baughman's response</A> to the question of how she has fared with resolutions so bravely made last Dec. 31.<P>
And don't forget to take a minute to add to our <A HREF="../../../oracle/corpse/index.html">Pretty Darned Good-Looking Corpse</A> tomfoolery as it unfolds, and to send us any tomfoolery of your own. We're in the mood to play!<P>

An interactive game for Televisionary Oracle fans who can extend a metaphor with the cunning skill of an expert taffy puller at a tombstone sale using the marble for a table while singing Hosannas to a coyote who wandered in for a chaw of smokeless pineapple-flavored doublemint and ended up falling in love with a New Age island cowboy from Kuala Lumpur whose desperate circus childhood has left him with a prediliction for pink popcorn, an unrequited love for a woman named Saori, a mastery of Noh theater, and an uncanny facility for the trampoline.
