<FONT SIZE=3>"Recipes?" demanded a reader with an ummistakable expression of disgust. "I thought that you people were hyper-feminists!" Well, we take issue with the notion that hyper-feminists don't cook--or eat, for that matter. After all, what does more to hyper up a feminist than good food? It's the dirty dishes that are the obvious marks of a pig-like sexist state.<BR><P>

As the Western Hemisphere sweats into August, we like our dinner to be as naked as we are. The following should be served to your lover on a spoon carved from the stake planted in your heart by your last lover. Dress is casual: wear only one clean linen napkin.<P><BR CLEAR=LEFT><P><BR><P>



<B>Tortellini with Tomatoes and Basil</B>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>As with love itself, there are many variables to preparing this dish. It may be as garlicky as you like; may be made with either fresh or dried pasta; and can be served either hot or at room temperature. We suggest that you make it ahead and leave covered outside of the fridge so that it's ready when you are. The plump seductiveness of these cheese-filled pasta are but a taste of late-summer lovemaking.<P>
<BR><P>
<UL>One pound cheese tortellini<BR>
6 firm, ripe Roma tomatoes, chopped roughly<BR>
One bunch of fresh basil, washed and chopped<BR>
1-4 cloves of chopped garlic<BR>
A large handful of grated parmesan or asiago cheese<BR>
Extra-virgin olive oil<BR>
Balsamic vinegar<BR>
Salt and pepper<P>
</UL>
<BR><P>

Prepare the tortellini according to package directions. While the water is boiling, chop the tomatoes, idly discarding seeds when you can. Chop the half the basil and all the garlic together--extra points for a mortar and pestle--and rub some of this behind your ears. Put the rest of the basil in a glass of cool water with some wildflowers near your bed. Put the tomatoes in the large bowl that you will serve the pasta in; add the garlic/basil mixture. Add about two tablespoons balsamic vinegar. When the tortellini is done, drain and add to the bowl. Immediately add the olive oil, shaking it gently over the pasta until the top layer has a pleasing sheen. The oil/vinegar proportion should be at least two-to-one. Add a large pinch of salt and a few good grinds of pepper. Toss thoroughly. Add 3/4 of the cheese; toss again. Use the rest of the cheese to top the bowl. This dish intensifies if left to swoon a little on the countertop. If you haven't yet finished that spoon-carving project, serve this out with your fingers.<P>
