You didn't actually think that we were going to recommend roasting plump little babies, biting the heads off of live doves, or rounding the Samhain celebration out with a few cups of warm blood . . . did you? Naw. The end of the year, the celebration of fall, and the honoring of ancestors calls for a dinner pretty much like one your mom would approve, unless she's a diabetic vegan. Menus that we've seen rely on roast pork, an apple dish, perhaps somethin' with pumpkin--none of them unusual for fall. But what snagged our sweet tooth was this cookie recipe.

<FONT SIZE=5><B>Hallomass (New Year) Cakes</B></FONT><BR>
makes about 3 dozen<BR>
dough must be chilled several hours or overnight<P>

<UL>
	1/2 c veg. oil<BR>
	4 sq unsweetened chocolate (4 oz), melted<BR>
	2 c granulated sugar<BR>
	4 eggs<BR>
	2 tsp vanilla<BR>
	2 c pastry flour (not whole wheat)<BR>
	2 tsp baking powder<BR>
	1/2 tsp salt<BR>
	1 c confectioner's sugar<BR>
</UL><P>


Mix oil, chocolate, and granulated sugar.  Blend in one egg at a time until well mixed. Add vanilla.  Measure flour by dipping method or by sifting.  Stir flour, baking powder, and salt into oil mixture.  Chill several hours or overnight.<P>

Heat oven to 350 deg F [175 deg C].  Roll about a Tb of dough into a ball (yes, it's messy).  Drop balls into confectioners' sugar, and roll around until coated.  Place about 2 inches apart on greased baking sheet. Bake 10-12 min. They will be a little soft but should not be mushy. Edges should be firm. Don't overbake--these burn easily. Obviously, this is not a low-fat, weight-watcher recipe.  This is a Grandma Recipe, and Grandma cooks with real butter.<P>
Bon appetit.<P>
