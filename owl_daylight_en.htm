<P> Dear David,
</P>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I make a point of expressing my satisfaction in front of the
illustration of cover of <I> The Divine Invasion </I> and the
masterly quality of volume as such.  In any frankness, none of my
works published had still reached a similar quality (I speak of course
about the object &quot; delivers &quot;).  I thank you.  As you know certainly
it, <I> The Divine Invasion </I> was the subject of a very
positive article in <I> Publishers Weekly, </I> which should
help it to be sold.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I benefit from this letter to inform you that I gave <I>
Bishop Timothy Archer </I> to <I> </I> my agent (I am besides very
content with the turning which took this novel, in particular with
regard to the character-point of sight, Angel Archer;  in my eyes,
Angel is perfectly real.  Never I had created of so real character!).
  I defer right now my attention on the novel of S.-F. that I owe you.
If I do not have a plan yet in a strict sense of the term, I am able
however to give you a small idea of his contents.  Consider what will
follow like a talk stripped of any official nature.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> This novel will be based more or less (as evoked you and me
in company of Russell Galen) on the Comedy of Dante - like on the
first part of Faust de Goethe.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> We are in the future.  A very old scientist supervises the
construction of a park of leisures (a little like the various &quot;
countries &quot; Disneyland) reproducing Berkeley, in California, in the
years 1949-1952, by including there the various sections of population
and other subcultures of the time.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In order to provide for coherence with the unit, it calls
upon one of the most powerful computers of the planet, which will be
charged to make function the Park;  the machine becomes in fact the
mental one which will manage it.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> However this machine tests resentment of it because it
prefers to solve problems abstracted, theoretical, on the highest
level.  It is avenged for the scientist by taking it with the trap of
its own Parc and by subjecting it to its will;  the scientist sees
himself allotting the physique of a high-school pupil and depriving of
the memories concerning his true identity (one sees here the influence
that Van Vogt could exert on me, as in a certain number of my
preceding novels).
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Our man of science, prisoner of the park and the computer
which it was wrong not to use advisedly (computer which knows it and
which is upset with him), is found confronted with the enigma-maze
which constitutes the Park and must find the exit of it by solving the
problems that the machine presents to him the ones after the others.
When it fails (the problems concern in their great majority the moral
choice), it notes in the Park (which for him is not the Park but
<I> the World) </I> of terrible deteriorations which
transform it little by little into <U> Hell </U> *. This
phenomenon causes in him an infinite perplexity since it forgot its
true identity, that it does not know that it evolves/moves in a park
of leisures or a labyrinth controlled by an artificial intelligence.

</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Useless to specify that when it answers the put question
correctly, it rises towards <U> the Paradise </U> *.
</P>
<P> That said, to be become again high-school pupil, it is not
less very intelligent;  its memories flew away, but its intellect is
intact.  It arrives at the conclusion which it clashes with some
mental great scale which subjects subtle problems to him, and which by
solving them (or while not succeeding in solving them) it sees either
punished, or rewarded, according to the case.  Thus it spends much
time to try to include/understand its situation (here which recalls so
much that is to say little <I> joined <B> Time out of
</I>  </B>!).  I would say that this need for solving enigmas
constitutes vertical <U> problems </U> *; it is articulated
around three concomitant axes ascension/chute, three reigns &quot; evoking
of present the parallels (such is at least the assumption that our
scientist chooses to retain, and who naturally appears false).  It is
assisted in that by a mysterious female figure which appears under
changing aspects and offers indecipherable indices to him;  it is
actually about his own daughter who, since the outside of the Park,
tries to enter in communication with him and to carry help to him
(being, in the Park, become again a teenager, he is now,
paradoxically, more young person that its own daughter).  In addition,
the computer appears to him under the features of various individuals
whom it meets and, by the means of these misadventures, poses the
problems to him to be solved.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In addition to this vertical axis, it moves along an
explicitly horizontal axis, that of the evolution and growth normals
in a young high-school pupil who finds soon his first employment, then
Marie:  it is the axis the length of which we move all.  Only we are
aware, whereas the axis vertical, is latent for him the, obscure one.
  It can be known only by inference, and no one other does not seem
conscious about it.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The small medium where it evolves/moves includes/understands
the homosexual community of the area of the Bay [ of San Francisco ]
at the time, the artistico-intellectual community (which recuts the
preceding category) political militants, the store which employs it,
his/her colleagues of work and his owner, appears enigmatic inspired
by Tony Boucher who encourages the young man to become writer of
science fiction.  The enigmas located at the highest level appear
through this last incarnation, which (since it speaks for the
computer) becomes a truly supernatural character about it.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I do not intend to openly treat the question of the religion,
but this ultimate level of enigmas to solve rev&#234;t a spiritual
colouring some;  their solution must also belong to this reign, to go
beyond the pure reasoning, of formal logic (the computer is really
<U> very </U> * advanced - it is well for that that it is
annoyed to see itself limited to the management of a park of
leisures).
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The advance of the young man thus continues with a marriage,
occasion for him to meet a woman who (proves it) is a incarnation of
her own daughter.  There still, the character is of supernatural
gasoline.  The computer surprises constantly the young man, the
armature in error, subjects enigmas to him, rewards it and punishes
it;  the female figure, it, plays a role of psychopompe, as in
<I> the Comedy </I> of Dante;  it informs it, it guides it,
it informs it.  Thus, the computer inspires to him deliberately by
amazement as a practitioner the misinformation, while the female
figure is as laconic as esoteric.  One could say that it is buckled.
And none of the two entities reveals its true nature with the young
man.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> If it is able to reach - by solve enigmas - what is called
here the &quot; &nbsp; Eighth Level &quot;, it will be expelled of the Park;
it will remember its true identity and will regain the real world.
There is thus well other thing concerned that a simple system of
ch&#226;timent/r&#233;compense:  the true objective, the end of the voyage, it
is the release - the release, the recollection, the return to
reality... the only means of escaping the tyranny exerted by the slave
become Master (concept that I cherished particularly and who comes
from Germanic mythology).
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> In the three &quot; reigns &quot; (inspired by <I> the Comedy)
</I> exist the same people, the same events, but each one has to
some extent its clean &quot; color &quot;.  They are the three fields of
European existential psychology:  <I> Eigenwelt </I> (on the
mode of rise), <I> Mitwelt </I> (where <I> </I> the mode is
that of the interaction with others, i.e. his rise there is not taken
but that one advances there while walking, quite simply) and <I>
Umwelt </I> (reign of under-human and enfermement;  the mode is
that of fossilization, of the stagnation;  faculty to be driven there
disappears purely and simply;  with its worst degree, it is the World
Fall).  Once that the young man is there, it is confronted with
formidable barriers preventing it from escaping, and it would
undoubtedly be shown some unable without the intervention of the
figure-girl, which responsability the role and capacity of Christ:  to
empty the hell of its inhabitants, including the young man.  I.e. it
<U> penetrates there since outside </U> * under the aspect of
a figure of Saver well defined, to be it who takes his defense, which
intercedes in its favour, its Lawyer.  Whereas the computer, which has
only hatred for him, draws from its own trick to subject problems
increasingly difficult to him to solve.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> One finds in this history two elements pointing out the myth
of Faust.  1)  In the Park, the scientist becomes again young;
outside, it is old.  However, it pays this youth the full price since
it is found under the yoke of mental Park, analogy of Satan, its
spirit and its capacity.  2)  The rise which it undertakes along the
vertical axis in order to gain the output is a displacement of nature
faustienne, which do not seize the other beings living in the Park.
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> The end that I imagine (even if it is not final at this
preliminary stage) is the following one:  when the scientist solves
the ultimate enigma, when it is free to leave the Park, it voluntarily
turns back in order to go to help those which remain trapped there;
it becomes of this fact <I> a bodhisattva, </I> and at the
time when it makes its decision the computer capitulates the man
overcame the machine on the spiritual level where it functioned;  at
the bottom, it opposed a paradox to him - the ultimate paradox:  it is
<U> him </U> * which poses the problem, <U> it </U>
* which must solve the problems;  and it is him which appears morally
higher than the machine which, consequently, agrees to remain mental
Park, but without the motivation of revenge.  The computer will see
from now on in the Park a world where the beings can, by its grace, to
see itself teaching the spiritual illumination;  ains
