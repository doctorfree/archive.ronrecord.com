Burlacticus Undertow played Friday night, September 15th, 2000
at Callahan's Pub in Santa Cruz. The Fuse opened (they've opened
before and i really enjoy 'em). Showtime was 9 PM.</H1>

Again we had a great time at Callahan's. It's one of the last un-trendy
dive bars with live music and no pretentions of being anything other than
what it is. The dance floor and stage are all one little postage stamp but
we usually seem to work it out. This particular night there was this bare
chested buff tatooed long haired guy who liked to stand up front watching.
I guess i accidentally brushed him at some point as i was bouncing all over
the place. Next thing i know this guy's manager or something is taking me
aside and warning me that if i touch his boss again i'll be leaving on a
stretcher. I just told the guy it was an accident and we were all just having
fun and why didn't the guy himself say anything to me. Well, that didn't
go over so good so i just kept myself surrounded by all the beautiful women
dancing that night. What a weird place Callahan's can be sometimes. I guess
as long as no one gets hurt it just lends a bit of edge to the heat.
<P>
It seemed like the band pulled out a couple of new tunes this gig. At least,
i think their cover of the Beatles "Helter Skelter" was new. It was pretty
wild and Rich keeps adding more wailing vocals (Rich, whaddya call that high
vocal Ian Gillan type thing anyway ?).
