    A couple of hours ago, at 12:45 am Beverly Hills time, my old friend and
    the corrupter of my youth Timothy Leary made good on his promise to "give
    death a better name or die trying." Willingly, peacefully, and unafraid,
    he
    headed off on his last trip.
  <P>
    He spoke his last words a few hours before. On the phone to the mordant
    William S. Burroughs he said, "I hope that someday I'm as funny as you
    are."
  <P>
    He didn't, as threatened, commit suicide on the Net. Or have his head cut
    off and frozen. Or engage in any other the other spectacles of departure I
    had dreaded. In the end, he surrounded himself with the angelic band of
    twenty-somethings who have been uploading him into the Web these last few
    months and drifted peacefully out of here.
  <P>
    I was headed his way when he died. When I was with him earlier this month
    he said, "When I leave here, Barlow, I want your face to be one of the
    last
    things I see." I think that was one of the sweetest things anyone ever
    said
    to me, and I was trying to make it possible, but death proved itself once
    again to be bigger and faster than either of us. The phone just rang in
    the
    middle of this rainy Wyoming night, and now I'm here naked in the dark
    trying to think of something to follow him out with.
  <P>
    Two years ago, Cynthia and I spent our last day together with Timmy. When
    she died the next day and it became so shockingly clear to both of us how
    strange this culture has become on the subject of the second commonest
    event
    in the world, how weirdly shameful is dying in America, we both thought it
    time to bring death out of the closet. I did so by grieving her, and
    continuing to grieve her, more publicly than is polite in a culture that
    claims for itself the ability to conquer and control everything.
  <P>
    But Timmy beat me to the barricades. He flat died. And he died, without
    pretending that he was "really going to get well any day now," without
    permitting himself to become a ghoulish and futile medical experiment,
    without contributing to the stupefying mass denial that causes almost 80%
    of America's health care dollars to be blown on the last six months of
    life.
  <P>
    He died unashamed and having, as usual, a great time.
  <P>
    A few weeks ago, the denizens of leary.com and I rented a phalanx of wheel
    chairs and rode them with him into the House of Blues on Sunset Strip, a
    place that likely had never seen fifteen people in wheel chairs before.
    After a truly merry time, we were headed back to his house and on the way
    came within a smile of Tim Leary's Last Bust.
  <P>
    We cruised west on Sunset. And the sun was setting. The top was down on my
    metallic mauve rent-a-convertible. A couple of the web girls, Trudy and
    Camilla, were sitting on the trunk like psychedelic prom queens,
    shoop-de-booping to the funk station on the radio, volume at eleven. Both
    the girls were beautiful, Trudy like a character from Neuromancer, Camilla
    like a character from Botticelli. The air was sweet and soft as a negligee
    on our faces, and the light had that elegiac quality that makes people
    think
    LA might not be so bad after all.
  <P>
    Timmy gave me a high five and grinned. "Life is good!" he shouted over the
    music. As I looked up to meet his raised hand, I saw in my rear view
    mirror,
    past the swaying torsos of the girls, the rotating reds of a real Beverly
    Hills cop.
  <P>
    Of course we were in possession of several of those substances that we
    considered safe and effective but which this culture, in another of its
    dangerous madnesses, has declared lethal, probably to distract heat from
    its own deadly drugs of choice. Furthermore, I had only recently paid an
    astonishingly steep California fine for allowing a friend to stand up
    through the sunroof of a car I was driving.
  <P>
    He pulled us over in front of the Beverly Hills Hotel. He looked like an
    Eagle Scout.
  <P>
    "Officer," I said, nodding back at the still improperly seated girls, "I
    know what we were doing was wrong. But you see, my friend here is dying,
    and we're trying to show him a good time." Timmy, without saying anything,
    smiled sheepishly at the cop and nodded, caught in the act.
  <P>
    He looked like hell but he sure looked happy.
  <P>
    The officer gazed into Timmy's beatific skull-face and lost his starch.
    "Well," he said to the girls, "I'd be lying if I didn't say that looks
    like
    fun, but just because he's dying doesn't mean you should. Now get down in
    the seat and buckle up and I'll let you go." I felt like honest death had
    just made one of its first converts.
  <P>
    In thirty years of following Tim Leary around, he's given me some
    wonderful
    and hair-raising moments. He has been father, anti-father,
    partner-in-crime,
    and devout fellow-worshipper of all that is female in this world. We loved
    each other, and shared more memories than I will ever relate. But I think
    the look he gave that cop is the memory I will cherish most.
  <P>
    As usual he was "cocking snooks at authority," as Aldous Huxley once
    accused
    him. But he was doing it, also as usual, with wit. And with love.
  <P>
    America managed to forgive Richard Nixon when he died. I hope they will
    extend the same amnesty to a real hero, Dr. Timothy Leary.
  <P>
    Yrs,
  <P>
    John Perry
