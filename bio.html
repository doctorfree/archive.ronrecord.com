  </CENTER>
  <A HREF="">Ronald Joe Record</A> worked for The Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) for over 25 years. In 2001 he was purchased
  by Caldera Systems as part of Caldera's acquisition of the server software division of SCO. In 2002 Caldera changed
  its name back to SCO.
  <P>
    After leaving SCO, Dr. Record built a successful business in Second Life creating and selling a variety of scripted
    objects including autonomous avatars that served as greeters, dancers, guides, agents, and sex robots. These smart
    avatars could query both Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha making them among the smartest AI avatars in the world.
  <P>
    Resuming his life as a hired gun in 2012, Ronnie accepted employment at VMware in Palo Alto. Working from home in
    Santa Cruz he was able to pioneer VMware's efforts in automated remediation, applications in health services,
    management and security of the Internet of Things, and automated SAP Landscape deployment and maintenance.
  <P>
    Currently Dr. Record is the Founder and Chief Scientist at the Institute for Applied Sensibility (IAS) headquartered
    in Santa Cruz, California. The IAS is researching distributed applications leveraging blockchain technology and
    smart contracts. IAS is funded by mining cryptocurrency.
