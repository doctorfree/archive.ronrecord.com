<H2><A NAME = "Employment">Ronald Joe Record's Employment History</A></H2>
<P>
In 1983 Ronald began working for the Santa Cruz Operation. At that time
there were approximately 50 employees. Ronald helped develop, build, test
and productize the first commercial release of Xenix on a PC (the IBM PC XT).
It was due to Mr. Record's diligent after-hours efforts that the Xenix Games
disk was created and included in all shipping SCO Operating Systems products
up until recently. Since then, Ron has worked as a Penguin (Product Engineering 
Utilities and Installations), Operating System engineer, builder of the dev sys,
World-wide Master of the Source, ODT Integration technical lead, X11 server and
clients source and build engineer, and Skunkware release engineer and 
contributor. Recently Ron served as the technical lead for the SCO Wabi project 
(a graphical client which will execute Windows applications in the UNIX/X11 
environment). Subsequently he worked on the SCO Desktop future strategy,
focusing on Internet enabling Technologies. He then became the Open Source
Program Architect for the Segment Marketing division at SCO.
<P>
Recently (Spring, 2001) the division Ronnie worked in at SCO was purchased
by <A HREF=http://www.caldera.com>Caldera Systems</A>, a Linux vendor. Doc
Record currently works in the engineering arm of Caldera as Open Source
Architect, producing hundreds and hundreds of RPMs included in both the
OpenLinux and Open UNIX distributions from Caldera.
<P>Ron has had a lot of fun, learned quite a bit, and made 
<A HREF="gif/friends.gif">some very good friends</A> during his time at SCO
and now at Caldera.
Here's a <A HREF=office.html>photo of Ronnie</A> in his office with Willow.
<P>
He recently updated his <A HREF="resume.pdf">resume</A> !
<P>
Prior to his work at SCO, Ronnie worked as a teaching assistant at UCSC
and as an intern at NASA Ames Advanced Guidance and Navigation laboratory.
While at NASA, Ron helped develop an automatic guidance system whose first
"real world" application was the aerial spraying of Malathion over Santa Clara
county. He also worked on the "Technology House", a demonstration of energy
efficiency and computer controlled house envisioned by the Carter administration
and quickly unfunded by the Reagan administration.
<P>
Prior to working at NASA, Ron worked as an Ion Implant operator at Advanced
Micro Devices, cleaning fish at the dock in Seattle, picking fruit in
Yakima Valley, planting trees on the Mescalero Apache reservation in New
Mexico, mending fence, milking cows, negotiator for the Rainbow Family
in their proposal to restore and reclaim damaged public lands, automobile
delivery agent, dishwasher &amp; busboy, Tastee-Freeze attendant,
basket boy, and sales of coke and candy.
<P>
Even more most recently (30-Jul-2002), Ronald Record was quoted in
<A HREF=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2002/07/30/MN34658.DTL>
<I>a front-page San Francisco Chronicle article</I></A> 
on the Silicon Valley workforce.
