<b>Comments:</b> Hi Ron,

Remember me, the gal from Cruzio who loves your parties? I just found your site an hour or so ago and got sucked in and whirled around. There's so much mass to your site, it may become a black hole someday and visitors will cross the event horizon and never escape. I especially appreciate your poetry section and hope it will expand. Reynaldo Recuerdo's way with words makes me smile, and that Ruckle fella's poems make my head spin in wonder.

Hope you and your sweetie are enjoying the summertime. I'm sorry, I can't remember her name, but I remember what a gleeful dancer she is. Lots of exuberance, like you. I wish I had a party to invite you to, but I just don't have a proper, or improper, party venue.

Anyhoo, take care and throw it out the window. Be carefree.

Dizzily yours,

Jessi<br>

<b>Comments:</b> What a sexy site! I love your pictures and fractal
graphics. The backgrounds are way cool. Are you
an artist as well as a poet, mathematician, web
designer and author ? I bet you're good in bed.

Love,

<b>Comments:</b> Dear Doctor,

If you know you are the coolest thing around, why do you boast in the third person? Just bust out with how cool you are without pretending that this is the script to a narrated episode of "Biography".

Have never seen such bragging in all of my life. Incredible.

<b>Subject:</b> Amazing Hour<br>
<b>Comments:</b> Hello, Dr.Record/Doc/Joe

I have just passed a fabulous hour on your site. The world of fractals, dynamical systems theory and visual math is mostly a world unknown to me...but now I know more than an hour ago.

When I pulled up your site, I was supposed to be researching Enid OK businesses who might respond to an emergency funding need for The Enid Salvation Army's Summer Day Camp program. Along with other Enid Ok sites, your webpage came up.

So as not to have wasted an hour of The Salvation Army's time, let me make a pitch to you.

The Enid Salvation Army is in urgent needs of funds for this summer's Day Camp Program. The Camp provides a great place to be for young "Cowboy Allen and Floyd" types who love to throw crabapples.

As a kid who seems to have benefited from growing up in Enid America, I hope you will make a donation to this request. (I see that you already support, as I do, The Big Brothers and Big Sisters Program). We won't ask you to bowl. Just go to Salvationarmy.org and donate online. Indicate funds are for Enid Day Camp. 

We're looking for $5,000 to cover our shortfall and all donations are appreciated. $45 will cover the cost for 1 child for one week of the summer.

Thanks for the experience your website provides...thought provoking, fun, unusual and a look at how one Oklahoman is living his life. Carry on.

<b>Comments:</b> Arrived here through some convoluted route from Phillips University alumni page. I was to have graduated class of '72, but attended '68-'71. I remember marching to the square to protest the war too.
We later found out that a seminary student had suffered a fatal heart attack in the protest. Anyway. Do the names Ray Lovelace, Jim Strain, Ren Pope, Kevin Byrne, Linda Ammons, Barbara Garrison or Melissa Webb mean anything to you?
Will continue to explore your site(s). Cool photos of you; glad to know a FEW of us turned out normal!
Best regards.

<b>Comments:</b> Your website is very creative and most interesting. I am encouraged to learn that Enid produced a true  Renaissance Man!

As soon as the "wind came sweeping down the plain"...I blew out of Enid as fast as I could. Though it's important to acknowlede that the "Enid Experience" provides a lifetime of knowledge -not to mention a wealth of memories worthy of high art! Austin, TX.     <br>
