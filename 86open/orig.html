<P></P>
<P>A group which includes some of the key developers of Unix operating systems
on Intel architecture computers have agreed to work on a common programming and
binary interface.</P>
<P>At a meeting held mid-August at the head office of SCO, participants
achieved consensus on a way to create software applications which would run,
without modification or emulation, on the Intel-based versions of:</P>
<UL>
<LI>BSDI</LI>
<LI>FreeBSD</LI>
<LI>Linux</LI>
<LI>NetBSD</LI>
<LI>SCO OpenServer</LI>
<LI>Sunsoft Solaris X86</LI>
<LI>SCO UnixWare</LI></UL>
<P>The goal of this effort is to encourage software developers to port to the
Unix-Intel platform by reducing the effort needed to support the diverse mix of
operating systems of this kind currently available.</P>
<P>The specification, called &quot;86open&quot;, will be published and freely
available to any environment wishing compliance. It involves the use of a
standardized <I>libc</I> shared library of basic functions to be provided on
all systems. This library will provide a consistent interface to programmers,
hiding the differences between the various operating systems and allowing the
resulting binary programs to run unaltered on any compliant system. Whenever
possible, it will be consistent with The Open Group's<I> Single Unix
Specification</I>.</P>
<P>Each participating operating system will be free to implement the 86open
library specification on its own. However, the reference implementation will be
based upon GNU's <I>glibc</I> version 2, ensuring that it will remain open and
freely available. The actual list and behavior of the 86open functions is
presently being determined.</P>
<P>Participants in the meeting, who will be involved with the ongoing evolution
of the 86open specification, include people deeply involved with the operating
systems mentioned in this project. The 86open steering committee, a core of this
group which will assemble the work and produce the final specification,
comprises:</P>
<P>Marc Ewing, Dion Johnson, Evan Leibovitch, Bruce Perens, Andrew Roach, Bryan
Sparks and Linus Torvalds</P>
