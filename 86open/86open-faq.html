The term <FONT COLOR="#FFFF00"><A NAME="Unix-on-Intel">Unix-on-Intel</A></FONT>
as used in this FAQ, refers to the subset of Unix systems specifically produced
to run on computers
based on industry-standard computer architectures using Intel&reg; 80386 and
compatible CPUs.</LI>
<P></P><LI>
Also, the term <A NAME="Unix"><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Unix</FONT></A>, as
used above and elsewhere in this FAQ, describes the entire realm of both
commercial UNIX&reg; operating
systems and others such as Linux and BSD which have similar design.</LI>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">PART 1 - HISTORY AND PURPOSE</FONT></H3>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Q1: What is <I>86open</I>?</FONT></P>
<P><I>86open</I> is a loose and informal group of technically-oriented people,
who work and/or program in the world of UNIX systems and compatibles on
Intel-based, standard-architecture computers (<A HREF="#Unix-on-Intel">Unix-on-Intel</A>)</P>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Q2: What are <I>86open's</I> goals?</FONT></P>
<P>Its goal is to address areas of common ground amongst a diverse group of
operating systems, including (but not limited to) multiple variants of freeware
OSs such as BSD and Linux, as well as commercial OSs from BSDI, SCO and Sunsoft.
Any agreements, specifications and software produced by it will be made freely
available (in source code where applicable).</P>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Q3: When did it start?</FONT></P>
<P>After some initial e-mail discussions took place, the first actual meeting
of the group took place at SCO's head office in Santa Cruz, California on August
22, 1997. That was the first and only physical meeting, everything since has
taken place by e-mail.</P>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Q4: Is it ongoing, or does it have a specific
goal in mind, after attaining which it would cease to exist?</FONT></P>
<P>This hasn't been discussed in great detail by the group. Work has already
started on <I>86open's</I> first project, a library specification allowing a
common binary to run without emulation on all participating operating systems
(see <A HREF="#Q15">Q15</A>): While some participants have envisioned other
projects once this first one is complete, all attention is presently focused on
the library project and not beyond.</P>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Q5: Isn't this just another one of the many Unix
alliances?</FONT></P>
<P>No. <I>86open</I> is significantly different from most previous Unix
industry groupings such as Unix International, the Open Software Foundation, the
COSE and ACE consortia, and others.</P>
<UL>
<LI>
This group is made up of individuals, not companies. While many of 86open's
participants share their own organizations' point of view, few officially
represent them. It is our belief that the quality of this group's work, as well
as its members' personal respect within their communities, will enable its works
to be implemented across the <A HREF="#Unix-on-Intel">Unix-on-Intel</A> world.</LI>
<P></P><LI>
Being a highly technical group, it members have a less-competitive
temperament than other groups which have been made up of management or marketing
representatives. Further, participation is totally voluntary and nobody is here
because they are forced to do so. This is, of course, just opinion, but it
appears to be borne out by many members of the group.</LI>
<P></P><LI>
<I>86open</I> is the first such group to have significant representation
from within the freeware (Linux and BSD) communities.</LI></UL>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Q6: Aren't you just doing this as a reaction to
Windows NT?</FONT></P>
<P>Yes and no. It would be a lie to deny that NT has provided a significant
challenge to the Unix community, and part of the weakness of the Unix community
is its high level of fragmentation. Anything that can be done to reduce this
degree of fragmentation, while allowing each participant to maintain its unique
set of strengths, is beneficial to the community as a whole.</P>
<P>On the other hand, there are many who believe that, NT or not, this effort
is necessary and long overdue.</P>
<P>The participants in <I>86open</I> generally believe that
<A HREF="#Unix-on-Intel">Unix-on-Intel</A> provides an unmatched combination of
value and performance, and that its installed base is large and growing
rapidly. We hope that our efforts on joint projects will highlight these
strengths before the computing public.</P>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">PART 2 - ORGANIZATION</FONT></H3>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Q7: Where and how is <I>86open</I>
incorporated?</FONT></P>
<P><I>86open</I> is not incorporated, and there are no plans to formalize it
to that extent. It has no budget, all costs to date have been borne by
individual participants or their employers.</P>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Q8: How is the group structured?</FONT></P>
<P>There are two main components to the <I>86open</I> group:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
The main group is about 30 people, who will jointly be involved in
producing projects mutually agreed-to. All decisions will be reached by
consensus of the group, with dissenting opinions accommodated whenever 
possible.</LI>
<P></P><LI>
A subset of this group, a seven-person 'steering committee', will handle
publicity and other administrative tasks. It will make no technical decisions on
its own.</LI></UL>
<P>To date the group has physically met once. Future meetings may be convened
but presently all collaborative work is done by e-mail.</P>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><A NAME="Q9">Q9</A>: What organizations are
represented here?</FONT></P>
<P>It cannot be emphasized enough that 86open is comprised of individuals, not
organizations. While we are doing our best to ensure that all possible <I>viewpoints</I>
are represented, we work under the premise that <I>nobody</I> in this group
speaks on behalf of their parent organization unless they explicitly say so.</P>
<P>Having said that, it is our desire that the fruits of our work are
implemented across the entire community of those who use and develop
<A HREF="#Unix-on-Intel">Unix-on-Intel</A>. To that end, we have tried to
attract individuals who can offer perspectives from across the community.</P>
<P>Current membership in the group reflects perspectives from
<A HREF="http://www.be.com/"> Be Inc. BeOS</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.bsdi.com/">BSDI BSD/OS</A>, <A HREF="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera

<A HREF="http://www.intel.com/">Intel&reg;</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.opengroup.org/">The Open Group</A>.</P>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Q10: Why isn't &lt;my operating system&gt; on
that list?</FONT></P>
<P>We have made reasonable attempts to solicit participation that reflects
viewpoints from across the <A HREF="#Unix-on-Intel">Unix-on-Intel</A> spectrum.</P>
<P>We may have missed some, inadvertently. Developers of any relevant OS are
encouraged to <A HREF="mailto:86open@telly.org">mail us</A> to help us fulfill
our tasks. The only OS whose developers have been invited to participate, but
declined, is OpenBSD.</P>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Q11: Who is involved?</FONT></P>
<P>Here is the current membership. Note that only names are given, not
affiliations, deliberately (see <A HREF="#Q9">Q9</A>). Members of the steering committee are in
<B>bold</B>:</P>
<P>Tim Bird, Keith Bostic, Chuck Cranor, Michael Davidson, Chris G. Demetriou,
Ulrich Drepper,  Don Dugger, <B>Marc Ewing</B>, Steve Ginzburg, Jon &quot;maddog&quot;
Hall, Ron Holt, Jordan Hubbard,  Dave Jensen, <B>Dion Johnson</B>, Kean
Johnston, Andrew Josey, <B>Evan Leibovitch</B>, Robert Lipe, Bela Lubkin, Tim
Marsland, Greg Page, <B>Bruce Perens</B>,  Ron Record, <B>Andrew Roach</B>,
Tim Ruckle, Joel Silverstein, <B>Bryan Sparks</B>, Chia-pi Tien, <B>Linus
Torvalds</B>, Erik Troan</P>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Q12: How can I become a member of the technical
group?</FONT></P>
<P>If you can offer a viewpoint that we don't have at this point, and if you
have the time/resources/skills to work on projects in this group's plan, please
<A HREF="mailto:86open@telly.org">mail us</A>. No promises -- there are
concerns that if the group gets too large it may be unworkable -- but we'll give
all requests their due.</P>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Q13: Is there any leader or chairperson?</FONT></P>
<P>At this time, no. Certain individuals have specific responsibilities, and so
far that's worked for us.</P>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Q14: Why the name <I>86open</I>?</FONT></P>
<P>It's simple, catchy, and describes both the group's focus (on
<A HREF="#Unix-on-Intel">Unix-on-Intel</A>, often referred to as &quot;X86&quot;
architectures) and the fact that the products of its work will be freely
available.</P>
<P>It's also reminiscent of &quot;88open&quot;, a respected industry group
formed many years ago to support the Motorola 88000 processor. The 88open group
ceased operations in 1994, and its last-known leadership is aware of our group
and has no objections to the use of the term <I>86open</I>. </P>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"><A NAME="Q15">Q15</A>: Do you have a logo?</FONT></P>
<P>We don't have one, and we're in no hurry to get one. Thanks for the offers,
but that's nowhere near the top of our priority list.</P>
<HR>
<H3><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">PART 3 - PROJECTS</FONT></H3>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Q16: So what exactly are you doing?</FONT></P>
<P>At the August meeting, the <I>86open</I> group reached a consensus to put
its initial efforts into a method to allow a single binary program to run,
unmodified, on any participating OS. That is, one could develop a program on
OpenServer that would run on FreeBSD, or develop on Linux and run on SolarisX86,
and so on.</P>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Q17: A single binary used by all Unix-on-Intel
OSs -- who won?</FONT></P>
<P>This was not a battle to be won or lost. The <I>86open</I> binary project
is <I>not</I> an emulation scheme in which one system's binary format becomes a
standard which others must support. Rather, a single binary, written to a
standard programming specification, will be able to run <I>natively</I> on all
supporting platforms.</P>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Q18: How can you get a single binary to work
identically across all these diverse systems?</FONT></P>
<P>Most <A HREF="#Unix-on-Intel">Unix-on-Intel</A> binary packages are already
largely similar. Almost all such operating systems use the &quot;ELF&quot;
binary 'packaging'; the various operating systems have small but significant
differences, though, that make each system's ELF binary unusable on others'.</P>
<P>Because of earlier binary compatibility efforts such as the iBCS2 (which has
been a part of UNIX since System V/386 Release 3.2), most of the older
functionality is already quite similar between the systems. Most of the
divergence has been in post-iBCS2 developments such as lstat() and mmap().</P>
<P>The <I>86open</I> group plans to solve this problem by producing a standard
set of library functions that would be provided on each participating OS. A
binary using these standard functions would dynamically link into the local
library containing them, thus allowing it to operate regardless of the different
internals of the underlying OS.</P>
<P>It is up the library implementation on each OS to hide any OS-specific
behavior behind the standard functions, allowing programmers to concentrate on a
single Application Programming Interface (API) for a binary that will work on
all systems.</P>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Q19: This might work in concept, but is it
practical?</FONT></P>
<P>Yes, absolutely. One such proof-of-concept is the
<A HREF="http://dontask.caltech.edu/lxrun">the <I>lxrun</I> project</A>, which
allows Linux binaries to work on SCO and Solaris operating systems by mapping Linux
OS-specific system calls to their SCO equivalents by use of a 'shim' library.</P>
<P> The feasibility of a common Unix-on-Intel binary by use of a single library
specification was agreed to by all the programmers involved.</P>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Q20: What will be in this new library?</FONT></P>
<P>That's what's being worked on at this time. The emphasis is on defining a
set of functions that is &quot;sufficient, yet limited&quot;, in the words of
Linux creator Linus Torvalds. The intention is to include all the basic
functions necessary to create applications (and act as a base for other
libraries, such as for X Windows), while removing redundancies and unnecessary
code according to the groups' consensus.</P>
<P>The group is starting with a conventional Unix 'libc' 
(<A HREF="http://www.imaxx.net/~thrytis/glibc/Glibc2-HOWTO.html">GNU's
<I>glibc2</I></A>) as
its point of reference. While any participant is welcome to create its own
implementation of the <I>86open</I> library specification, the reference will
be based on glibc.</P>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Q21: What programs will benefit?</FONT></P>
<P>The intent of the 86open library specification is that it will be
sufficiently complete to allow most kinds of software applications to use it
in lieu of the OS-specific libraries required presently. We will attempt to
offer documentation to assist developers to port existing applications to the
<I>86open</I> library functions.</P>
<P>We understand that certain kinds of software that must necessarily be close
to the OS kernel will probably <I>not</I> benefit from the portability aspects
of the <I>86open</I> specificationi. This is because such programs, such as
performance monitors, will require OS-specific facilities beyond the scope of
our efforts.</P>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Q22: How will you ensure that the specification
is open?</FONT></P>
<P>The license of GNU glibc requires that it's freely available in source code,
and that all modifications to it be similarly available. Furthermore, <I>86open</I>
 is committed to maintaining a reference implementation of its library
specification that is available in source code and freely re-distributable.</P>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Q23: Won't this library specification create
just another Unix 'standard'?</FONT></P>
<P>This is certainly not our intent. Wherever possible we will remain
consistent with The Open Group's
<A HREF="http://www.UNIX-systems.org/online.html">Single Unix Specification</A>.
But there may be areas the group needs to address --- such as direct video
access --- that are architecture-specific and thus outside the scope of the SUS.</P>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Q24: When will the specifications and reference
library be available?</FONT></P>
<P>Progress is being made. But it's too early to promise any deliverables, and
the consensus is that it's better to say &quot;we're not sure&quot; than to pick
a date out of thin air and lie. We like to think we're above that; being open
can mean more than releasing source code.</P>
<HR>
<H3><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">PART 4 - FUTURE</FONT></H3>
<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Q25: Is anything planned once the library
specification is complete?</FONT></P>
<P><I>86open</I>  is fully aware that a common binary -- while a significant
step -- is only part of the solution to making the <A HREF="#Unix-on-Intel">Unix-on-Intel</A>
platform attractive and easy-to-support for application developers.</P>
<P>While nothing is concrete -- all attention is presently focused on the
library project -- further issues have been raised that may be later addressed
by <I>86open</I>, such as installation systems and common filesystem layouts.
It must be emphasized, however, that future projects haven't been dealt with any
level of detail, and likely won't until the current one is near completion.</P>
