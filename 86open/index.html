You decide.</font></font>
<p>On October 1997, a group informally calling itself <i>the 86open project</i>
issued a communiqu&eacute;, discussing the need for a standard binary executable
for the various Unix and Unix derivatives which run on Intel 80X86 "PC"-architecture
systems.
<p>The group, which had met earlier that year at the headquarters of SCO,
eventually included representatives or developers involved with the most
popular such operating system suppliers:
<ul>
<li>
BeOS</li>

<li>
BSDI</li>

<li>
FreeBSD</li>

<li>
Linux</li>

<li>
NetBSD</li>

<li>
SCO</li>

<li>
Sunsoft</li>
</ul>
The aim of this effort was to encourage software developers to port to
the Unix-Intel platform by reducing the effort needed to support the diverse
mix of operating systems of this kind currently available.
<p>The original target was a&nbsp; binary format specification which would
supportable by each OS, without emulation, in addition to (but not to replace)
each OS's native format. The early discussions centered around Linus Torvalds'
scheme involving a standardized programmers' function libraries, and agreement
on numbering schemes for signals and other interfaces.
<p>The group was making reasonable, if slow, progress into mid 1998. At
that time, SCO was involved in the development of <i>lxrun, </i>software
<a href="http://www.caldera.com/developer/core7/linux.htm">which
ran Linux-format binaries under the two SCO operating systems</a>&nbsp;
(OpenServer and UnixWare).
<p>The possibility that SCO could run Linux binaries made the need for
86open less important. Most of the BSD programs already have solid capabilities
for running Linux binaries.
<p>The lxrun package is now stable and runs well. It was <a href="http://www.caldera.com/press/releases/1999/6847.html">officially
announced by SCO</a> at LinuxWorld in March 1999, and was later ported
by Sun <a href="http://www.sun.com/linux/lxrun/">to allow Linux binaries
to run under SolarisX86</a>.
<p>With these announcements, the need for a distinct common binary standard
is gone. The operating system vendors, one way or another, have chosen
a common binary format -- the Linux ELF format, which is now supported
on the systems of all the developers which originally joined <i>86open</i>.
<p>It is therefore only logical that the 86open project declare itself
dissolved. Our goal -- the development of a single binary that software
vendors can trust will run on most Unix and Unix-derivatives on PC platforms
-- has been realized. It didn't come about the original way we had planned,
but we achieved what we set out to do.
