butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance
accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give
orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch
manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die
gallantly.  Specialization is for insects."</I>

"So we bleed her just enough to try and provide for the less fortunate, but not
enough to kill her. She's also a ravenous, myopic, and messy bird who would
gobble up all the resources and crap all over the environment if left to her 
own devices. So we try and pen her up and limit her plate. And she responds 
by giving us smaller eggs. Now the goose is anemic. What to do, what to do?"

"[Music is] a hard game to enter at my age . . . I'd
 like to have it like it used to be, but there's
 censorship going on . . . California music was born
 from the people that came out here in the Depression,
 the _Grapes_of_Wrath_ people that Steinbeck wrote
 about.  They wound up out here and built houses and
 beer joints.  So what you got here is barroom music
 from a bunch of sincere, hardworking old boys like
 Merle Haggard and Buck Owens and Wynn Stewart and
 Skeets McDonald and people like that who were
 appreciated by those knock-down, drag-out dancing,
 oil-field working, cotton-picking people.
 They've never seen people like that in
 Nashville.  They only hear about them in songs."
