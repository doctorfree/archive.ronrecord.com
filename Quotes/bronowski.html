From the "Knowledge or Certainty", an episode from the 1973 BBC series 
"The Ascent of Man", transcribed by Evan Hunt:

<P>
	The Principle of Uncertainty is a bad name.  In science--or
	outside of it--we are not uncertain; our knowledge is merely
	confined, within a certain tolerance.  We should call it the
	Principle of Tolerance.  And I propose that name in two senses:
	First, in the engineering sense--science has progressed, step by
	step, the most successful enterprise in the ascent of man, because
	it has understood that the exchange of information between man and
	nature, and man and man, can only take place with a certain
	tolerance.
<P>
	But second, I also use the word, passionately, about the real
	world.  All knowledge--all information between human beings--can
	only be exchanged within a play of tolerance.  And that is true
	whether the exchange is in science, or in literature, or in
	religion, or in politics, or in *any* form of thought that aspires
	to dogma.  It's a major tragedy of my lifetime and yours that
	scientists were refining, to the most exquisite precision, the
	Principle of Tolerance--and turning their backs on the fact that
	all around them, tolerance was crashing to the ground beyond
	repair.
<P>
	The Principle of Uncertainty or, in my phrase, the Principle of
	Tolerance, fixed once for all the realization that all knowledge is
	limited. It is an irony of history that at the very time when this
	was being worked out there should rise, under Hitler in Germany and
	other tyrants elsewhere, a counter-conception:  a principle of
	monstrous certainty.  When the future looks back on the 1930s it
	will think of them as a crucial confrontation of culture as I have
	been expounding it, the ascent of man, against the throwback to the
	despots' belief that they have absolute certainty. 
<P>
	It is said that science will dehumanize people and turn them into
	numbers.  That is false: tragically false.  Look for yourself.
	This is the concentration camp and crematorium at Auschwitz.
	*This* is where people were turned into numbers.  Into this pond
	were flushed the ashes of four million people.  And that was not
	done by gas.  It was done by arrogance.  It was done by dogma.  It
	was done by ignorance.  When people believe that they have absolute
	knowledge, with no test in reality--this is how they behave.  This
	is what men do when they aspire to the knowledge of gods. 
<P>
	Science is a very human form of knowledge.  We are always at the
	brink of the known; we always feel forward for what is to be hoped.
	Every judgment in science stands on the edge or error, and is
	personal.  Science is a tribute to what we *can* know although we
	are fallible.  In the end, the words were said by Oliver Cromwell:
	"I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ:  Think it possible you may
	be mistaken." 
<P>
	We have to cure ourselves of the itch for absolute knowledge and
	power.  We have to close the distance between the push-button order
	and the human act.  We have to *touch people*.
