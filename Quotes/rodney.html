A girl phoned me the other day and said .... Come on over,

If it weren't for pick-pockets I'd have no sex life at all.

And we were poor too. Why if I wasn't born a boy.... I'd have
nothing to play with.

During sex my girlfriend always wants to talk to me. Just the
other night she called me from a hotel.

One day as I came home early from work ..... I saw a guy jogging
naked. I said to the guy .... Hey buddy .... why are you doing
that for? He said ....Because you came home early.
<DT>

It's been a rough day. I got up this morning .... put on a shirt
and a button fell off. I picked up my briefcase and the handle
came off. I'm afraid to go to the bathroom.

When I played in the sandbox, the cat kept covering me up.

I could tell that my parents hated me. My bath toys were a
toaster and a radio.

My mother never breast fed me. She told me that she only liked
me as a friend.

My father carries around the picture of the kid who came with his
wallet.

When I was born .... the doctor came out to the waiting room and
said to my father .... I'm very sorry. We did everything we could . . .
but he pulled through.

My mother had morning sickness after I was born.

I remember the time I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of my
finger to my father. He said he wanted more proof.

Once when I was lost..... I saw a policeman and asked him to help
me find my parents. I said to him ..... do you think we'll ever
find them? He said ... I don't know kid .... there are so many
places they can hide.
<DT>
<HR>
<P>
On Halloween .... the parents send their kids out looking like
me. Last year... one kid tried to rip my face off! Now its
different...when I answer the door the kids hand me candy.

I worked in a pet shop and people kept asking how big I'd get.

I went to see my doctor. Doctor, every morning when I get up and
look in the mirror... I feel like throwing up; What's wrong with
me? He said... I don't know but your eyesight is perfect.

My psychiatrist told me I'm going crazy. I told him .... If you
don't mind I'd like a second opinion. He said .... Alright....

When I was born, the doctor took one look at my face . . .
turned me over and said. Look ... twins!

I remember when I swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills. My doctor
told me to have a few drinks and get some rest.
