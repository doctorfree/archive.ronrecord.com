Dear kindly Mr. Trumpke, 
You gotta understand, 
It's just our bringin' up-ke 
That gets us out of hand. 
Our mothers all are junkies, 
Our fathers all are drunks. 
Golly Moses, natcherly we're punks! 

<B>PRESIDENT TRUMPKE</B>
You live in your poverty,
Your schools are no good,
You have no jobs,
58 percent of your youth is unemployed.
What the hell do you have to lose?

<B>ACTION AND JETS </B>
Gee, President Trumpke, we're very upset; 
We never had the love that ev'ry child oughta get. 
We ain't no delinquents, 
We're misunderstood. 
Deep down inside us there is good! 

<B>PRESIDENT TRUMPKE</B>
They’re bringing drugs.
They’re bringing crime.
They’re rapists.
And some, I assume, are good people.

<B>ACTION</B> 
There is good! 

<B>ALL</B> 
There is good, there is good, 
There is untapped good! 
Like inside, the worst of us is good! 

<B>PRESIDENT TRUMPKE</B>
They’re rapists.
And some, I assume, are good people.

<B>SNOWBOY</B>: (Spoken) That's a touchin' good story. 

<B>ACTION</B>: (Spoken) Lemme tell it to the world! 

<B>SNOWBOY</B>: Just tell it to the judge. 

<B>ACTION</B> 
Dear kindly Judge, your Honor, 
My parents treat me rough. 
With all their marijuana, 
They won't give me a puff. 
They didn't wanna have me, 
But somehow I was had. 
Leapin' lizards! That's why I'm so bad! 

<B>PRESIDENT TRUMPKE</B>
In the ninth month,
You can take the baby,
And rip the baby out of the womb of the mother
Just prior to the birth of the baby

<B>DIESEL</B>: (As Judge) Right! 

President Trumpke, you're really a square; 
This boy don't need a judge, he needs an analyst's care! 
It's just his neurosis that oughta be curbed. 
He's psychologic'ly disturbed! 

<B>ACTION</B> 
I'm disturbed! 

<B>PRESIDENT TRUMPKE</B>
She's probably deeply troubled
And therefore great in bed.
How come the deeply troubled women,
You know, deeply, deeply troubled,
They're always the best in bed?

<B>JETS</B>
We're disturbed, we're disturbed, 
We're the most disturbed, 
Like we're psychologic'ly disturbed. 

<B>DIESEL</B>: (Spoken, as Judge) In the opinion on this court, this child is depraved on account he ain't had a normal home. 

<B>ACTION</B>: (Spoken) Hey, I'm depraved on account I'm deprived. 

<B>PRESIDENT TRUMPKE</B>
My fingers are long and beautiful,
As it has been well documented,
Are various other parts of my body.

I’ve said if Ivanka weren’t my daughter,
Perhaps I’d be dating her.

<B>DIESEL</B>: So take him to a headshrinker. 

<B>ACTION</B> (Sings) 
My father is a bastard, 
My ma's an S.O.B. 
My grandpa's always plastered, 
My grandma pushes tea. 
My sister wears a mustache, 
My brother wears a dress. 
Goodness gracious, that's why I'm a mess! 

<B>PRESIDENT TRUMPKE</B>
His father was with Lee Harvey Oswald
Prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot.
I mean, the whole thing is ridiculous.
They don't even talk about that.
That was reported, and nobody talks about it.
I mean, what was he doing, what was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald
Shortly before the death? Before the shooting? It's horrible.

<B>A-RAB</B>: (As Psychiatrist) Yes! 
President Trumpke, you're really a slob. 
This boy don't need a doctor, just a good honest job. 
Society's played him a terrible trick, 
And sociologic'ly he's sick! 

<B>ACTION</B> 
I am sick! 

<B>ALL</B> 
We are sick, we are sick, 
We are sick, sick, sick, 
Like we're sociologically sick! 

<B>PRESIDENT TRUMPKE</B>
I don’t care how sick you are.
I don’t care if you just came back from the doctor
And he gave you the worst possible prognosis, meaning it’s over.
You won’t be around in two weeks. Doesn’t matter.
Hang out 'til November 8th. Get out and vote, and then,
All we’re gonna say is, ‘We love you and we will remember you always.’

<B>A-RAB</B>: In my opinion, this child don't need to have his head shrunk at all. Juvenile delinquency is purely a social disease! 

<B>ACTION</B>: Hey, I got a social disease! 

<B>A-RAB</B>: So take him to a social worker! 

<B>ACTION</B> 
Dear kindly social worker, 
They say go earn a buck. 
Like be a soda jerker, 
Which means like be a schumck. 
It's not I'm anti-social, 
I'm only anti-work. 
Gloryosky! That's why I'm a jerk! 

<B>PRESIDENT TRUMPKE</B>
A well-educated black has a tremendous advantage
Over a well-educated white in terms of the job market.
If I was starting off today,
I would love to be a well-educated black,
Because I really do believe
They have the actual advantage today.

<B>BABY JOHN</B>: (As Female Social Worker) 
Eek! 
President Trumpke, you've done it again. 
This boy don't need a job, he needs a year in the pen. 
It ain't just a question of misunderstood; 
Deep down inside him, he's no good! 

<B>ACTION</B> 
I'm no good! 

<B>PRESIDENT TRUMPKE</B>
He’s a Mexican,
We’re building a wall between here and Mexico.
The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings
Rulings that people can’t even believe.

<B>ALL</B> 
We're no good, we're no good! 
We're no earthly good, 
Like the best of us is no damn good! 

<B>PRESIDENT TRUMPKE</B>
You really want to know
What I consider ideal company?
A total piece of ass.

<B>DIESEL</B> (As Judge) 
The trouble is he's crazy. 

<B>A-RAB</B> (As Psychiatrist) 
The trouble is he drinks. 

<B>BABY JOHN</B> (As Female Social Worker) 
The trouble is he's lazy. 

<B>DIESEL </B>
The trouble is he stinks. 

<B>A-RAB </B>
The trouble is he's growing. 

<B>BABY JOHN </B>
The trouble is he's grown. 

<B>PRESIDENT TRUMPKE</B>
It must be a pretty picture.
You dropping to your knee

<B>ALL</B> 
Trumpke, we got troubles of our own! 

Gee, President Trumpke, 
We're down on our knees, 
'Cause no one wants a fellow with a social disease. 
Gee, President Trumpke, 
What are we to do? 
Gee, President Trumpke, 
Fuck you!
