Doc Record is the proud parent of three. His son, 
<A HREF="ChrisRecord.gif">
Christopher Robinson Record</A>, is currently ... uh, it's kinda hard to keep
up with Chris. He's just gone off to lead a seminar on E-Commerce and
he does custom web design and consulting. This paragraph used to show
his exhibit of <A HREF="jpg/wall.jpg"> spray paint art</A> on the controversial
<!-- A HREF="http://www.cruzio.com/arts/gal/walls/bayst/bayindex.html" -->
Art Wall in Santa Cruz at the corner of California and Bay. Here he is
<A HREF=jpg/chrisnw.jpg>with Willow</A>.

Eldest daughter, Aloha Luna Christina Record, served
as President of her Freshmen and Sophomore classes at Harbor High School,
has maintained a 4.0 GPA for several years, was elected to
serve as the Harbor High ASB Vice-President, and graduated with honors in
two fields (Politics and History) from the
University of California at San Diego (more straight A's).
<A HREF="jpg/chris+aloha.jpg">Both Chris and Aloha</A> are

<A HREF="jpg/tike.jpg">Willow Irene Record</A>
was born at home on February 6th of 1994 
(The 99th anniversary of Babe Ruth's 
and 49th anniversary of Bob Marley's birthdays).
Here she is as a <A HREF=jpg/willow.jpg>cute little baby</A> and
here she is <A HREF=jpg/july4_1999_2b.jpg>marching</A> in the Fourth
of July "World's Smallest Parade" in Aptos, California in 1999. And
<A HREF=jpg/july4_1999_3b.jpg>again</A>. I like this parade. The Zero
Population Growth people were costumed as cars looking for parking spaces.
The cars had bumper stickers that said "Make Love Not More".
<P>
At the time of this writing, <A HREF=jpg/willowsm.jpg>Willow</A> has just 
started 6th grade at <A HREF=http://www.gatewaysc.org/>Gateway School</A> 
in Santa Cruz. This is a picture of her on 
<A HREF=jpg/school.jpg>her first day of first grade</A>. She loves 
dressing up and has a wonderful <A HREF=jpg/scarf.jpg>sense of style</A>.
Willow likes to hang out with our neighbors who are mostly
college students at UCSC. Here she is with <A HREF=jpg/rachel.jpeg>
her best friend and spiritual sister, Rachel</A>
(full <A HREF=jpg/rachelfull.jpeg>uncropped image</A>).
Here she is with Chris, Aloha and her other best friend, 
<A HREF=jpg/awcab.jpg>Baylee Bordwell</A>.

A descendant of 
<A HREF="jpg/records.jpg">Arkansas hill folk</A>, Ronnie's father, Joe,

Ronnie's mother, 
<A HREF="jpg/mom+willow.jpg">Lois Elaine (Campbell)</A> is of Scottish descent.
Her great grandfather, <A HREF=Stories/campbell.html>Thomas Lopton Campbell,
Jr.</A> was an American pioneer in 7 states, served as a Texas Ranger,

<A HREF="Poems/Donnie/Don.html">Donnie</A>, and two sisters,

<P>
It is possible that the Record family can count
<A HREF=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Recorde.html>
Robert Recorde</A>, a 16th century Welsh mathematician/physician/teacher,
as an ancestor. Recorde introduced the equals sign (=), was the first
mathematician to publish in English rather than Latin or Greek (sort of the
Martin Luther of Math), was physician to King Edward VI and Queen Mary, and
died in debtor's prison due to political retribution from his powerful enemy
the Earl of Pembroke. He also wrote "The Urinal of Physick". Here are some
quotes attributed to Robert Recorde:
<P>
Exercise is the beste instrument in learnyng.
<BR>
The Whetstone of Witte
<P>
To avoide the tediouse repetition of these woordes: is equalle to: I will
settle as I doe often in woorke use, a paire of paralleles, or gemowe [twin]
lines of one lengthe: =, bicause noe .2. thynges, can be moare equalle.
<BR>
Quoted in G Simmons Calculus Gems (New York 1992).
<P>
Besides the mathematical arts there is no infallible knowledge, except that it
be borrowed from them.
