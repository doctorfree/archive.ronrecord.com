      <h1>Standard Button bars</h1>
    </center>
    This is inspired by bjelli's work at
    <a href="http://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/">COSY</a> in Austria.
    <p>
      Button bars are a simple navigation tool. They contain pointers to useful
      places, usually pointers back to root nodes of the hierarchy. Button bars
      tend to be useful because they are consistent navigation tools within the
      document. They should remain consistent over a broad range of documents,
      thus helping the user build a mental map.
    </p>

    <p>
      The two sample icon bars are set up for Stanford CS departement, but the
      gist should be clear enough for you to make your own button bar files.

    <h2>Server-side includes</h2>
    The button bars outlined here depend on server side includes. The details on
    how this are at
    <a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/tutorials/includes.html"
      >HooHoo</a
    >
    at NCSA. [You must have the NCSA server or similar which allows server side
    includes]

    <h2>The Comment to Include a File</h2>
    To include the file we put a comment in the file that is replaced by the
    contents of the file itself.
    <pre>
 &lt;!--#include virtual="gif/buttons/icons.pcd.inc" --&gt;
  </pre
    >
    Of course, the file name would probably be different, and note that the
    included file <em>must</em> be on the same server as the document. It's not
    a good idea to try and include button bars stored on other servers. For one
    thing, it takes too long to load.
    <p>
      Since the <code>&lt;!--#include ... &gt;</code> is a mouthful for users to
      remember to type, it is a good idea to <a href="include.html">include</a>
      this as part of the standard
      <a href="template.html">template</a>
      file given to users.
    </p>

    <h2>The Included File</h2>
    This is the file that is included. Changing the button bar involves changing
    this file only - the source files remain as they are. The site administrator
    is responsible for maintaining this file.
    <p>
      The <a href="gif/buttons/icons.pcd.inc">PCD include file</a> and the
      <a href="gif/buttons/icons.csd.inc">CS dept. include file</a> can be
      downloaded.
    </p>

    <pre>
    &lt;!-- Include file --&gt;
    &lt;!-- Icon bar for CS dept, PCD group --&gt;
    &lt;A HREF="http://www.stanford.edu/"&gt;
    &lt;IMG SRC="gif/buttons/stanford.seal56.gif" ALT="Stanford"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

    &lt;A HREF="http://www-cs.stanford.edu/"&gt;
    &lt;IMG SRC="gif/buttons/logo.csd.gif" ALT="CS dept"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;

    &lt;A HREF="http://www-pcd.stanford.edu/"&gt;
    &lt;IMG SRC="gif/buttons/logo.pcd.gif" ALT="PCD grp"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
