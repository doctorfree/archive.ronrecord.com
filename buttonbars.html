<H1>Standard Button bars

This is inspired by bjelli's work at 
<A HREF="http://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/">COSY</A> in Austria.
<P>
Button bars are a simple navigation tool.  They contain pointers to
useful places, usually pointers back to root nodes of the hierarchy.
Button bars tend to be useful because they are consistent navigation tools
within the document. They should remain consistent over a
broad range of documents, thus helping the user build a mental map.
<P>
The two sample icon bars are set up for Stanford CS departement, but
the gist should be clear enough for you to make your own button bar
files.

<H2>Server-side includes</H2>
The button bars outlined here depend on server side includes.
The details on how this are at 
<A HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/tutorials/includes.html">HooHoo</A>
at NCSA. [You must have the NCSA server or similar which allows server 
side includes]

<H2>The Comment to Include a File</H2>
To include the file we put a comment in the file that is replaced by
the contents of the file itself.
<PRE>     &lt;!--#include virtual="/gif/buttons/icons.pcd.inc" --&gt;

Of course, the file name would probably be different, and note that the
included file <em>must</em> be on the same server as the document.  
It's not a good idea to try and include button bars stored on other
servers.  For one thing, it takes too long to load.
<P>
Since the <CODE>&lt;!--#include ... &gt;</CODE> is a mouthful for users
to remember to type, it is a good idea to <A HREF="include.html">include</A> 
this as part of the standard 
<A HREF="template.html">template</A>
file given to users.


<H2>The Included File</H2>
This is the file that is included.  Changing the button bar involves changing
this file only - the source files remain as they are.
The site administrator is responsible for maintaining this file.
<P>
The <A HREF="/gif/buttons/icons.pcd.inc">PCD include file</A> and  
the <A HREF="/gif/buttons/icons.csd.inc">CS dept. include file</A> can be downloaded.
