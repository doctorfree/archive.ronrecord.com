<title>Talk:Rupert Sheldrake - Wikipedia</title>
<p>What follows is a discussion I initiated on the Wikipedia Talk page for <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Sheldrake>the article on Rupert Sheldrake</a>, author and biologist primarily known for his hypothesis on <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogenesis>morphogenesis</a> in biological cells. Here is the opening sentence of that article at the time I started the discussion:
<p><b>Alfred Rupert Sheldrake</b> (born 28 June 1942) is an English author, and researcher in the field of <a href="/wiki/Parapsychology" title="Parapsychology">parapsychology</a>, who proposed the concept of morphic resonance, a conjecture which lacks mainstream acceptance and has been characterised as <a href="/wiki/Pseudoscience" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>.</p>
<p> And here is the discussion:</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Dr._Sheldrake_is_a_bioligist">Dr. Sheldrake is a bioligist</span>
</h2>
<p>The lead paragraph in this article on a living person characterizes Sheldrake as a researcher in parapsychology first and a practitioner of pseudoscience. The lead paragraph should portray the individual in his or her primary role and impact upon society. In this case, that would be as bioligist. It's a travesty of truth to allow the ulra-rationalists to deface the Wikipedia article on one of the most impactful bioligists of the 20th century. Yes, Sheldrake has dabbled in experiments outside the norm. He video taped pets waiting for their owner to come home trying to see if pets are psychic. But he also has published many many many peer reviewed research papers in the field of biology and that is his primary influence on society. If the editors who have defaced this page applied the same standards to Sir Isaac Newton then Newton's Wikipedia article would open with a paragraph describing him as a religious maniac obsessed with alchemy and the occult. No mention would be made in the opening paragraph of Newton's Wikipedia article of his contributions to Physics or Mathematics.
</p><p>In short, this article violates the Wikipedia guidelines for articles on living persons. It is very nearly libelous. Who the heck is in charge here? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Doctorfree" title="User:Doctorfree">Ronald Joe Record</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Doctorfree" title="User talk:Doctorfree">talk</a>) 02:33, 11 January 2020 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Sheldrake is no Newton.</dd>
<dd>Can you provide sources the demonstrate Sheldrake's work in biology is as noteworthy as his work in parapsychology? --<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ronz" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ronz" title="User talk:Ronz">talk</a>) 05:04, 11 January 2020 (UTC)
<dl><dd>A complete list of Sheldrake's scientific and technical publications can be found on his website at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.sheldrake.org/about-rupert-sheldrake/scientific-and-technical-publications" data-external="true">https://www.sheldrake.org/about-rupert-sheldrake/scientific-and-technical-publications</a></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>These include publications in the Journal of Experimental Botany, Nature, Biological Reviews, and many more widely respected scientific journals. I do not understand the rationale for mostly ignoring this significant several decades of research and publication in peer reviewed scientific journals and devoting most of the lead paragraphs to a misrepresentation of his work and a biased critical review of his less important and non-peer reviewed research and publications in paranormal or metaphysical areas. The criticism in the lead should be moved to a section on controversy or criticism and the lead should be revised to state simply what he has done including his extensive research and publication in the fields of biology and botany. Sheldrake's principle contribution to biology has been his research and formulation of theories surrounding the still unsolved problem of cell differentiation, the genesis of form at the cellular level. His current work, on Faraday Wave-Patterns in Water, explores the possible relationship between resonant frequencies, wave patterns, and morphogenesis as a possible mechanism for cell differentiation. It's a fundamental question in Biology and remains a mystery. Sheldrake is exploring what I would consider fringe theories but he does so with scientific rigor and answers to questions like this may indeed require fringe thinking. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Doctorfree" title="User:Doctorfree">Ronald Joe Record</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Doctorfree" title="User talk:Doctorfree">talk</a>) 19:07, 11 January 2020 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Your argument is not persuasive. According to the list on Sheldrake's own page, the last of his publications in Nature was in 1974. The recent ones are basically flim-flam in dubious journals. Well, the researc into  Faraday waves may be genuine, but "morphogenesis" is basically a magic-based idea, for which there is zero evidence, so this is just a coatrack (if I have the technical term correct). I think the consensus is that if it were not for the woo stuff, Sheldrake would probably not pass WP:GNG. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Imaginatorium" title="User:Imaginatorium">Imaginatorium</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Imaginatorium" title="User talk:Imaginatorium">talk</a>) 10:15, 12 January 2020 (UTC)
<dl><dd>A list of his publications alone doesn't help. Independent sources are required. --<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ronz" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ronz" title="User talk:Ronz">talk</a>) 17:38, 12 January 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Doctorfree" title="User:Doctorfree">Doctorfree</a>, so the last reality-based research he published was in 1987, and really he stopped publishing anything meaningful in biology in 1981 (14 years after his PhD). Most of his active publishing life has been spend pushing "morphic resonance", telepathy and other bollocks. I think you just demonstrated that the lead is exactly correct. <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JzG" title="User:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:JzG" title="User talk:JzG">help!</a>)</small> 18:39, 13 January 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I am not making a notability argument nor did I intend the list of Sheldrake's publications to serve as sources. The list can be used to identify independent sources such as Nature and Biological Reviews. There are dozens of legitimate sources to establish Sheldrake as a notable contributor to the field of biology. My argument here is that the lead paragraph characterizes Sheldrake as an author and researcher in parapsychology then, in the very first sentence of the article, jumps right into criticism characterizing his work as pseudoscience. I am not arguing for removal of this biased and inaccurate perspective, I am suggesting it should be moved to a section on criticism of his work and the lead paragraph should more appropriately characterize Sheldrake as a researcher in the field of biology whose main contribution has been the formation of theoretical mechanisms of morphogenesis in biological cells.</dd>
<dd>Sir Isaac Newton spent the majority of his later life, 30 or 40 years, publishing biblical analysis and works on the occult and alchemy. If the Wikipedia article on Newton started by characterizing him as a biblical scholar whose primary works focused on the occult and alchemy, I would be making this same argument over on the Isaac Newton talk page. Of course, Sheldrake is not Newton. However, the formulation of hypotheses addressing one of the most fundamental questions in biology, cell differentiation and morphogenesis, is paramount and represents Sheldrake's primary contribution to science.</dd>
<dd>Sheldrake's current research continues to propose as an underlying mechanism for cell differentiation some sort of resonant field - he speculates either an acoustic or electric field, likely electric, which generates resonant frequencies giving rise to form in the underlying medium. Demonstrations of this effect can be seen in Faraday wave-patterns in water. It's science, not pseudoscience. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Doctorfree" title="User:Doctorfree">Ronald Joe Record</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Doctorfree" title="User talk:Doctorfree">talk</a>) 21:26, 12 January 2020 (UTC)
<dl><dd>You are making an argument for a radical change in pov based upon only your personal opinions.</dd>
<dd>Please drop the Newton comparison. --<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ronz" title="User:Ronz">Ronz</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ronz" title="User talk:Ronz">talk</a>) 18:28, 13 January 2020 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Doctorfree" title="User:Doctorfree">Doctorfree</a>, Newton was an alchemist and exposure to mercury led him to be paranoid. He was also a complete arsehole. He burned the only known portrait of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hooke" title="Robert Hooke">Robert Hooke</a> and tried (unsuccesfully, luckily) to have Hooke's papers at the Royal Society destroyed. For a long time this was put down to Hooke and he fighting, but if you look at the facts it is clear that Hooke was a very popular man and held in the highest regard by almost everybody. He conducted about half of all the surveys by the fire court after 1666, because he had a reputation for being almost pathologically honest. Newton wrote the third volume of <i>Principia</i> in a way that was deliberately calculated to make it impossible for Hooke to understand it, according to contemporaneous accounts.</dd>
<dd>So: Sheldrake is indeed a bit like Newton - if instead of publishing <i>Principia</i>, Newton had stuck to Deist philosophy and alchemy. <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JzG" title="User:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:JzG" title="User talk:JzG">help!</a>)</small> 18:44, 13 January 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Doctorfree" title="User:Doctorfree">Doctorfree</a>, Sheldrake is known only for his contributions to woo. If he had not gone off on one about the scientific community's failure to accept his morphic resonance conjecture, he would almost certainly be unknown and have no article here. Promoting woo is what he is known for, and there's no evidence he's done any meaningful work in any other area for a decade or more. <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JzG" title="User:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:JzG" title="User talk:JzG">help!</a>)</small> 18:33, 13 January 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Let me summarize to clarify. Please correct me if I misrepresent your view(s).
</p><p>I opened a discussion here claiming that Sheldrake is primarily and most significantly a biologist whose work in fundamental areas of the field should be reflected in the opening paragraph. In addition, I suggested that the criticism currently in the opening should be moved to a section on criticism. I would also suggest that his work in parapsychology be moved to a subsection but that is a secondary argument we can discuss later if need be.
</p><p>The responses in this discussion raise the following points in opposition to my views:
</p>
<dl><dd>Sheldrake's published works in the field of biology were primarily in the 70s and 80s. That is too long ago. (Please help me to understand this seemingly main argument being presented here - that his principle work was done at an earlier age and in his later years he shifted focus to metaphysical matters).</dd>
<dd>Sheldrake would not pass notability were it not for his later works in the field of parapsychology. That is, his published works in Nature and other peer reviewed scientific journals would not have been sufficient to qualify him as notable.</dd>
<dd>I am making an argument for a significant change based upon my personal opinion</dd></dl>
<p>I believe the main issue here is one's evaluation of the significance of Sheldrake's work in the 70s and 80s in the field of biology as reflected by his many publications in peer reviewed scientific journals as well as his many speaking presentations at conferences. I consider his work to be fundamental, addressing one of the most important unanswered questions in biology, and significant in that he formulated a hypothesis for the underlying mechanism governing cell differentiation and the genesis of form at the cellular level. Yes, it is my opinion. I worked in the field as a mathematician responsible for the creation of mathematical models attempting to explore the possibility that harmonic frequencies produced by electromagnetic fields in the cell structure could be responsible for cell differentiation. Sheldrake's work was invaluable to our studies and he was quite notable in the field of biology well before he began writing and speaking about metaphysical subjects. Sheldrake's contributions to biology extend beyond the formulation of hypotheses surrounding cell differentiation. He also provided insight and kindled interest in research into the ageing and death of cells "in an attempt to explore the significance of these processes in relation to growth and development, both normal and abnormal".
</p><p>I disagree with the assertion that Sheldrake would not be notable were it not for his work in parapsychology. He was and is notable for his work in biology and was widely acknowledged within and without the scientific community well before he embarked on metaphysical studies. I do not believe he would be notable were it not for his work in biology.
</p><p>Lastly, I do not understand this argument that because his primary work in biology was done in his 30s and 40s while his work in parapsychology was done in his 60s and 70s that the article should therefore reflect only his metaphysical works, along with a criticism of his work as pseudoscience, in the lead paragraph. Most research scientists and mathematicians throughout history have achieved their prominent works at an early age. Many by the time they are in their mid-20s. They spend the rest of their lives promoting, defending, clarifying, expanding, and refining the work they did in their youth. Some shift focus to entirely different fields. If we applied the same standard to other scientists, I think the absurdity of such a standard would become obvious. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Doctorfree" title="User:Doctorfree">Ronald Joe Record</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Doctorfree" title="User talk:Doctorfree">talk</a>) 17:53, 14 January 2020 (UTC)

<dl><dd>This is basic Wikipedia - all his recent work and publications are in a clear pseudoscience field and he is well known for that.  His earlier work in biology is well in the past and while it may have be useful it probably wasn't enough to gain enough notability for an article.  We reflect what is not what we might like to be the case -----<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Snowded" title="User:Snowded"><b style="color: #801818; font-family: Papyrus;">Snowded</b></a> <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Snowded#top" title="User talk:Snowded"><small style="color: #708090; font-family: Baskerville;">TALK</small></a></sup> 19:06, 14 January 2020 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I'll add: There won't be any changes without independent, reliable sources. Unsupported personal opinions matter little.

<dl><dd>You asked for independent sources earlier. I pointed you to a list of Sheldrake's scientific and technical publications which includes full references to articles published in Nature, Biological Reviews, and the Journal of Experimental Botany.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>I would be happy to learn more about this "basic Wikipedia" guideline. Can you point me to the Wikipedia policy or guideline that I can read to learn more about why a researcher's early work is less important or relevant than his recent work? Thanks.</dd>
<dd>Several commenters have stated here that Sheldrake's work in biology in the 1970s and 1980s was not sufficient to qualify as notable for an article. How did you all arrive at this conclusion? The many articles he authored and published in peer reviewed scientific journals would seem to qualify as notable. The articles on parapsychology, published in non-peer reviewed non-scientific journals would not seem to justify notability. I am having a hard time understanding the logic here. Please bear with me and thank you for any clarification. Also, see Water Journal Vol 9 published in October of 2017 for Sheldrake's latest published scientific and technical work, definitely not pseudoscience. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Doctorfree" title="User:Doctorfree">Ronald Joe Record</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Doctorfree" title="User talk:Doctorfree">talk</a>) 20:19, 14 January 2020 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Thank you for the clarification, pointers, and advice. I was not addressing my comments in this discussion to the task of establishing notability. Were I to do that with Sheldrake it would likely be by using  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(academics)" title="Wikipedia:Notability (academics)">Wikipedia:Notability (academics)</a> and providing independent sources to establish at least Criteria #3 listed there:
<dl><dd>"The person has been an elected member of a highly selective and prestigious scholarly society or association (e.g., a National Academy of Sciences or the Royal Society) or a fellow of a major scholarly society which reserves fellow status as a highly selective honor (e.g., Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)."</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>All of the following are easy to establish, have plenty of independent sources for verifiability, and qualify as satisfying the above criteria for notability:
<dl><dd>Sheldrake is a former research fellow of the Royal Society, he studied natural sciences at Cambridge University, where he earned a PhD in biochemistry and was awarded the university’s botany prize. He was a Frank Knox Fellow studying philosophy at Harvard University and became a fellow of Clare College, Cambridge, and director of studies in biochemistry and cell biology. From 1974 to 1985 he worked as a plant physiologist in Hyderabad, India.</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>In addition, one could establish notability using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(academics)#Citation_metrics" title="Wikipedia:Notability (academics)">Wikipedia:Notability (academics)#Citation_metrics</a> to document citations to his published peer reviewed articles in scientific journals, another way to establish academic notability.</dd>
<dd>But I did not intend to open a discussion on notability. I simply wanted to point out that Dr. Sheldrake is a biologist, that his primary impact has been in the field of biology, and the lead paragraph should reflect that. Further, the lead sentence of the article dives right into criticism. I did not think it would be controversial or even all that disputed that Sheldrake's credentials and publication history would demonstrate easily that the lead should reflect his work in the field of biology. However, it seems like there is firm disagreement about that among editors who have chosen to comment here. I'll step back and wait for others, if any, to come forward. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Doctorfree" title="User:Doctorfree">Ronald Joe Record</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Doctorfree" title="User talk:Doctorfree">talk</a>) 01:08, 15 January 2020 (UTC)

<dd>Concur, the weight of citations is to the pseudo-science stuff and its all he talks about having made the error of going to and asking a question at one of the HTLGI sessions - I'd be tempted to say it is also a cult.

<dd><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Doctorfree" title="User:Doctorfree">Doctorfree</a>, RESPECT MAH BIOLOGISTISM! To which the response is, sure, if you can show reliable independent secondary sources which do that. <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JzG" title="User:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:JzG" title="User talk:JzG">help!</a>)</small> 15:56, 15 January 2020 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>I do not think this discussion should be closed until several issues raised here are satisfactorily resolved. These issues include:
<dl><dd>What are the Wikipedia requirements/guidelines/criteria for stating that a person is a biologist</dd>
<dd>Is it appropriate for the lead sentence in an article that is a biography of a living person to include criticism of the subject rather than simple statements of fact</dd>
<dd>Is the age of scientific peer reviewed publication a determining factor in consideration and is there a Wikipedia guideline on this</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>With regards to the first, publication in peer reviewed scientific journals in the field qualifies as criterion for determining if a person is a biologist or a member of another field of science. To quote Jimmy Wales in his March 23, 2014 response to a change.org petition concerning Wikipedia guidelines and policies on fringe science and pseudoscience:
<dl><dd>"Wikipedia's policies around this kind of thing are exactly spot-on and correct. If you can get your work published in respectable scientific journals - that is to say, if you can produce evidence through replicable scientific experiments, then Wikipedia will cover it appropriately."</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>Further, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:USINGPRIMARY" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:USINGPRIMARY">WP:USINGPRIMARY</a>, following a list of characteristics for reliable sources, states that:
<dl><dd>A primary source can have all of these qualities, and a secondary source may have none of them. Deciding whether primary, secondary or tertiary sources are appropriate on any given occasion is a matter of good editorial judgment and common sense, not merely mindless, knee-jerk reactions to classification of a source as "primary" or "secondary".</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>The dozens of papers authored by Sheldrake and published in peer reviewed scientific journals in the field of biology constitutes reliable sources to establish Sheldrake as a biologist. Their publication date is irrelevant unless some intervening research has obviated the relevance of those publications. Nor is the fact that subsequent to the scientific publications the author opined on other topics, discontinued some lines of research, or embarked upon research and speculative hypotheses in fringe areas.</dd>
<dd>However, notability as a biologist does require additional sourcing. Citation indices are the standard for scientific notability. There is room here for further discussion and research. Sheldrake's notability as a biologist can be established through his academic memberships, posts, and fellowships. I am not making a notability argument here, simply pointing out along with reliable sourcing that Sheldrake's works qualify him as a biologist.</dd>
<dd>The comments here stating that this is just my opinion or RESPECT MAH BIOLOGISTISM (huh?) are ill informed and mistakenly asserting guidelines that either do not exist (e.g. his work in the field of biology was not recent) or are misinterpretations of guidelines (criteria for classification of a person as a scientist in a particular field requires secondary sourcing - publication in peer reviewed scientific journals in the appropriate field is sufficient). It's not even clear that citing a peer reviewed publication in support of a claim that the person is a biologist is appropriately considered a primary source since the content of that publication is not being cited, simply the fact of publication is what is relevant - the source is "Nature" or "Biological Reviews" not the content of the article by Sheldrake.</dd>
<dd>The second unresolved issue, should there be criticism in the lead paragraph describing a living person, has not been addressed by anyone. I do not see how this can be disputed. The critical components of the lead paragraph should be moved to a section on criticism.</dd>
<dd>Why be so quick to close this discussion? Generally what this discussion is intended to accomplish is conformance with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and eliminate some of the possibly unintended bias in the article. That is an important goal especially in light of the fact it is an article on a living person. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Doctorfree" title="User:Doctorfree">Ronald Joe Record</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Doctorfree" title="User talk:Doctorfree">talk</a>) 17:27, 16 January 2020 (UTC)</dd>
