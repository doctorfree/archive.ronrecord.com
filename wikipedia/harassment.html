  In July of 2018 the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Brezsny">Rob Brezsny Page at Wikipedia</A> saw massive edits, reverts, deletions, and issue tag placement in what at first appeared to me to vandalism. On Wikipedia vandalism is very common, accounting for a good deal of editors time correcting and rolling back to a good previous state. I "watch" the Rob Brezsny page on Wikipedia as I contributed to it years ago and it was automatically placed on my watch list. So, when these massive edits happened I was alerted and checked them out.
<P>
  The article on Brezsny had lain mostly dormant for the previous 4 years with only a couple of edits by myself a year ago and a couple more 2 years ago - minor edits revising citations and adding bands he was in. The page was over a decade old with very few modifications occurring over most of those years. The references/citations were old and definitely needed cleaning up but the page had been fairly stable for quite some time after resolving issues long ago over notability and "Peacock language" about 10 years ago. Then along came <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Drmies">Wikipedia User Drmies</A> with these heavy handed edits. I rolled them back and joined a discussion on the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Rob_Brezsny">Rob Brezsny Talk Page</A> that had been previously opened by <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Skyerise">Wikipedia User Skyerise</A>. I posted on the talk page the following:
  <P>
  "I reverted the article to the version prior to edits by User:Drmies. We need to improve the citations, not wholesale delete relevant sections of a biography of a living person. His edits removed the sections on the person's music career and writing career. The Amazon citations should now be replaced with better citations or removed."
  <P>
  Unfortunately, I also had questioned in my edit comment whether this was vandalism. I should have looked at the editor's page before suggesting it might have been vandalism. I apologized for this later but it had no effect on stemming the tide of harrassment and attacks that were to arise from this.
<P>
  Here is what happened, from my perspective, after I rolled back the changes to the previous known consensus version of that page.
<P>
  <HR>
  <DL>
    <DT><UL><LI>User Drmies immediately reverted my reversion</UL>
      <DD><P>Drmies' reversion comment was the following:
        "i'm fine with edit-warring over this: this is just promotion. we don't link articles unless they are provably special, and a bunch of these are just websites."
  <P>
        Essentially Drmies was calling for an edit war rather than resolving editorial differences on the article's talk page!
        <DT><UL><LI>I looked up User Drmies on Wikipedia and discovered he was formerly on the Arbitration Committee, one of the most powerful positions on Wikipedia.</UL>
          <DD><P>Uh Oh, I am in trouble now
  </DL>
  <HR>
  That sets the stage - I reverted a powerful editor's edits, questioning whether they were vandalism, and he hit me with full fury. Here are some of the actions taken against me and placed on the page I was trying to improve:
<P>
  <HR>
  <DL>
    <DT><UL><LI><B>An "Undisclosed payments" template tag was placed on the article. This template tag states:</B></UL>
      <DD><P>This article may have been created or edited in return for undisclosed payments, a violation of Wikipedia's terms of use."
  <P>
        An editor or editors of the Brezsny page is essentially being accused of accepting payments in exchange for favorable edits to the page, a promotional scheme used unethically by some commercial interests on Wikipedia.
        <DT><UL><LI><B>Multiple other tags were placed on the article including warnings about it being a biography of a living person and containing unreliable sources.</B></UL>
          <DD><P>This is a practice known as "tag bombing". These tags are templates added to the page and generally leave the impression to the average reader that the page is not well maintained, contains untrustworthy information, and in this case may be the product of unethical editing practices.
              <DT><UL><LI><B>After deleting much of the content, removing many of the citations, and adding the various template tags, the article was nominated for deletion.</B></UL>
          <DD><P>The Article for Deletion (AfD) process is a way for Wikipedia editors to discuss and come to a consensus on whether an article should be deleted. In this case the claim was made that the subject of the article, Rob Brezsny, does not meet the Wikipedia criteria for Notability. That is, he is not a notable character and does not deserve a Wikipedia page. Brezsny has been continuously published in over 120 weekly newspapers for over 40 years. He is the author of 3 books and numerous articles. He is a singer/songwriter and his most recent band, World Entertainment War, has a Wikipedia page and were signed by Bill Graham. He wrote two songs subsequently recorded by Jefferson Starship. He wrote, produced, and contributed to the soundtrack for the independent film "The Drivetime".
              <P>Rob Brezsny easily meets the Wikipedia criteria for notability. However, the citations on his page are old and need significant improvement. Rather than discuss on the talk page and work to improve the article, the Wikipedia Powers That Be have sabotaged the page and nominated it for deletion.
                <DT><UL><LI><B>My personal talk page was tagged with a "User talk page spam" template</B></UL>
          <DD><P>Apparently because my reversion of the Brezsny article to a state prior to Drmies changes contained some unreliable sources this prompted Drmies to characterize my change as spam and tag my personal talk page as such.
              <DT><UL><LI><B>My comments in the AfD discussion were edited and partially hidden</B></UL>
          <DD><P>The examples I provided of critical acclaim for Brezsny's book "Pronoia is the Antidote for Paranoia" were hidden from view with a template that says they are irrelevant. The critical acclaim comes from literary luminaries like Tom Robbins and Robert Anton Wilson. One of the Wikipedia criteria for notability of authors is "has won significant critical attention".
              <DT><UL><LI><B>
                      I kept asking for an explanation of the "Undisclosed payments" tag but got no response until one editor said the following:
                    </B></UL>
          <DD><P>
              "We are attempting to improve the content and citations" along with the rest of their way of arguing really does suggest marketing/promotional activity.
              <P>
                I inquired further and, yes, my use of the word "we" led this editor to conclude that my editing activity was marketing/promotional. I explained that by "we" I was referring to myself and the other editors who were editing the article in question and that yes, we really were attempting to improve the content and citations.
              <DT><UL><LI><B>
                      A particularly adversarial Wikipedia editor, <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Beyond_My_Ken">User Beyond My Ken</A>, submitted a proposal that I be banned from the Brezsny article. Here is the text of his proposal:</B></UL>
          <DD><P>User:Doctorfree, who signs as "Ronald Joe Record", is editing disruptively here in this thread, on Rob Brezsny and, especially, on Talk:Rob Brezsny:
    <UL>
      <LI>He WP:Bludgeons the talk page constantly, questioning every edit by every editor except himself
      <LI>He insists on adding information to the article supported by sources that a child would know don't fulfill the requirements of WP:RS
      <LI>His fawning attitude towards the subject of the article - a barely notable horoscope columnist - shows that he is incapable of editing neutrally about the subject
      <LI>His editing and comments border on being WP:Tendentious editing
      <LI>His disdain for community standards hides behind the veneer of a WP:CPOV-pusher
    </UL>
      For these reasons, I propose that Doctorfree, aka "Ronald Joe Record", be topic banned from the article Rob Brezsny.
      <P>
              <DT><UL><LI><B>
                      Wikipedia User Beyond My Ken (BMK) also kept asserting that I have a conflict of interest and should not be allowed to edit the Brezsny page but he would not provide any evidence of COI and refused to discuss it with me.
                    </B></UL>
          <DD><P>
              I asked BMK several times to provide any comment, action, or edit I had made that would lead one to believe I have a conflict of interest. Here is our exchange on his talk page:
              <P>
                <B>[ME]</B> Your recent revision of one of my edits to Rob Brezsny included the comment "You have a COI and should not be editng this article". I do not believe I have a conflict of interest wrt this article/person. What leads you to assert that? Can you direct me to any evidence or indication of a COI in this regard? Thanks. Ronald Joe Record (talk) 15:10, 21 July 2018 (UTC)
                <P>
                  <B>[BMK]</B> My reasons are clearly stated in the AN/I discussion. I have nothing further to add. Please don't edit the article directly. Beyond My Ken (talk) 16:13, 21 July 2018 (UTC)
                <P>
                  <B>[ME]</B> The article is AfD and I am the editor that has added the majority of independent 3rd party reliable sources in citations to that article. Prohibiting me from editing and improving the article while it is up for AfD seems unfair. I'm trying to locate any specific action or comment or edit of mine that would lead you to believe I have a conflict of interest with respect to Rob Brezsny. Your comment in the AN/I discussion is as follows: " Your comments here and on the article talk page show quite clearly that you have a conflict of interest in regard to Rob Brezsny, in that you are obviously incapable of adhering to a neutral point of view concerning them. Whatever the reason is for this, I have no idea, but the inability to edit neutrally is very apparent. I would suggest that you follow the recommended procedures in the WP:COI policy and do not edit the Rob Brezsny article again, instead making suggestions for edits on the talk page, and allowing other, unbiased, editors decide whether to implement them." Could you direct me to any comment or action or edit that supports that point of view? Thanks. Ronald Joe Record (talk) 02:09, 22 July 2018 (UTC)
                <P>
                  <B>[BMK]</B> I'm not interested in having a discussion with you on my talk page. Beyond My Ken (talk) 02:17, 22 July 2018 (UTC)

  <B>UPDATE:</B>
<P>
User Drmies was a candidate in the 2018 Wikipedia Arbitration Committee election. As a long time editor with enough edits to qualify, I am allowed to vote in these elections. Wikipedia elections provide the voters with 3 options - "Support", "Neutral", and "Oppose". I voted "Oppose" on Drmies. Candidates' vote totals are calculated by subtracting the number of "Oppose" votes from the number of "Support" votes. Drmies lost by 21 votes. Hahaha!
