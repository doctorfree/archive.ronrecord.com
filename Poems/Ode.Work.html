<P>
Thou annointest me with praise and promotion,
<BR>Thou favorest me with perk and party,
<BR>Thy paycheck and thine project are mine.
<P>
<BR>Oh, how sweet the scent of thy sweat -
<BR>The blessed perspiration of thy success.
<BR>Tis from the bosom of thy factories that i drink.
<P>
<BR>Oh, work, i find myself in thee and thee in me.
<BR>My days are made full and my nights rest full because of thee.
<BR>Mine hands are filled with pleasure at thy touch.
<P>
<BR>Yeah, toil and struggle are rewarded bi-weekly and with bonus,
<BR>Thou transformest my labor into gaseous vapors vent from volvos,
<BR>Mine actions into rent offerings unto the Lords of the Land.
<P>
<BR>Unto thee i come daily and in sleep i dream of thee.
<BR>Know thee me not ?
<BR>Hast thou not kept me and fed me lo these years ?
<P>
<BR>Ah, Lord of Labor, know this -
<BR>Tis i that have fattened you,
<BR>Tis i that spent my soul for thy fortune.
<P>
<BR>Yet, give me pause this day to thank you.
<BR>For twas my gift, my labor of love.
<BR>And i have fathered for you many products.
<P>
<BR>So let us take our luncheon long and lay beneath the sun.
<BR>Twas labor in painful pleasure that brought us forth,
<BR>And we, in labor, bear both sweet and bitter fruit.
