  <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Altarwise by owl-light in the half-way house<br>

  The gentleman lay graveward with his furies;<br>

  Abaddon in the hangnail cracked from Adam,<br>

  And, from his fork, a dog among the fairies,<br>

  The atlas-eater with a jaw for news,<br>

  Bit out the mandrake with to-morrows scream.<br>

  Then, penny-eyed, that gentlemen of wounds,<br>

  Old cock from nowheres and the heaven's egg,<br>

  With bones unbuttoned to the half-way winds,<br>

  Hatched from the windy salvage on one leg,<br>

  Scraped at my cradle in a walking word<br>

  That night of time under the Christward shelter:<br>

  I am the long world's gentlemen, he said,<br>

  And share my bed with Capricorn and Cancer.<br>

  </font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Death is all metaphors, shape in one history;<br>

  The child that sucketh long is shooting up,<br>

  The planet-ducted pelican of circles<br>

  Weans on an artery the genders strip;<br>

  Child of the short spark in a shapeless country<br>

  Soon sets alight a long stick from the cradle;<br>

  The horizontal cross-bones of Abaddon,<br>

  You by the cavern over th black stairs,<br>

  Rung bone and blade, the verticals of Adam,<br>

  And, manned by midnight, Jacob to the stars.<br>

  Hairs of your head, then said the hollow agent,<br>

  Are but the roots of nettles and feathers<br>

  Over the groundowrks thrusting through a pavement<br>

  And hemlock-headed in the wood of weathers.<br>

  </font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial">First there was the lamb on knocking knees<br>

  And three dead seasons on a climbing grave<br>

  That Adam's wether in the flock of horns,<br>

  Butt of the tree-tailed worm that mounted Eve,<br>

  Horned down with skullfoot and the skull of toes<br>

  On thunderous pavements in the garden of time;<br>

  Rip of the vaults, I took my marrow-ladle<br>

  Out of the wrinkled undertaker's van,<br>

  And, Rip Van Winkle from a timeless cradle,<br>

  Dipped me breast-deep in the descending bone;<br>

  The black ram, shuffling of the year, old winter,<br>

  Alone alive among his mutton fold,<br>

  We rung our weathering changes on the ladder,<br>

  Said the antipodes, and twice spring chimed.<br>

  </font></p>

  <p align="left"><font face="Arial">What is the metre of the dictionary?<br>

  The size of genesis? the short spark's gender?<br>

  Shade without shape? the shape of the Pharaohs echo?<br>

  (My shape of age nagging the wounded whisper.)<br>

  Which sixth of wind blew out the burning gentry?<br>

  (Questions are hunchbacks to the poker marrow.)<br>

  What of a bamboo man amomg your acres?<br>

  Corset the boneyards for a crooked boy?<br>

  Button your bodice on a hump of splinters,<br>

  My camel's eyes will needle through the shroud.<br>

  Loves reflection of the mushroom features,<br>

  Still snapped by night in the bread-sided field,<br>

  Once close-up smiling in the wall of pictures,<br>

  Arc-lamped thrown back upon the cutting flood.</font></p>
