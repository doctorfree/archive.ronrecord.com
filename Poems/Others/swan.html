                Dusk
              above the
          water hang the
                    loud
                   flies
                   Here
                  O so
                 gray
                then
               what            A pale signal will appear
              when        Soon before its shadow fades
             where      Here in this pool of opened eye
            in us     No upon us As at the very edges
             of where we take shape in the dark air
              This object bares its image awakening
                ripples of recognition that will
                   brush darkness up into light
even after this bird this hour both drift byatop the perfect
sad instant now     already passing out of sight
                 toward yet-untroubled reflection
               this image bares its object darkening
              into memorial shades scattered bits of
            light      No of water Or something across
            water        Breaking up no being regathered
             soon          Yet by then a swan will have
              gone              yes out of mind into what
               vast
                pale
                 hush
                  of a
                  place
                   past
         sudden dark as
             if a swan
                sang
