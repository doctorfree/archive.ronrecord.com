I dropped out of kindergarten to explore
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eternal youth
<BR>
I talked back to Mr. Science to defend 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eternal truth
<BR>
I saw angels in my playpen
<BR>
They taught me to kiss the sky
<BR>
I unlocked all nature's secrets
<BR>
Cross my heart and hope to die
<BR>
I bailed out of daddy's airplane
<BR>
Fell to earth like angel dust
<BR>
I broke into Caesar's Palace
<BR>
Looking for eternal lust
<BR>
Every time I found a goddess
<BR>
We had sex by accident
<BR>
No one ever tried to stop me
<BR>
When I fired the government 
<BR>
I don't need no paradise
<BR>
Living here is twice as nice
<BR>
I don't need no therapy
<BR>
Free of freedom 
<BR>
Free of me
<BR>
I totally fucking lost my pattern
<BR>
I totally fucking lost my pattern
<BR>
I totally fucking lost my pattern
<BR>
I broke into symbiosis
<BR>
Worked my voodoo to the bone
<BR>
Everything I love surrounds me
<BR>
Never never am alone
<BR>
I broke into kindergarten
<BR>
To destroy the evidence
<BR>
I danced backwards on the tombstones
<BR>
to restore my innocence
<BR>
