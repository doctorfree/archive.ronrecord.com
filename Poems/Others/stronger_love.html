<P>
	I made it all up
<BR>
	Nothing was true
<BR>
	I made it all up just to tease you
<BR>
	I gave it away
<BR>
	Nothing was mine
<BR>
	I gave it all away to try to please you
<BR>
	And I never fought in Beirut or Danang
<BR>
	Never killed anyone to impress you
<BR>
	I did not save the world
<BR>
	I hope you understand
<BR>
	It's not easy to prove that I love you
<P>
	(It's love)  I'll change myself for you
<BR>
	(It's love)  And there's nothing that I wouldn't do
<BR>
	(It's love)  I will explode for you
<BR>
	Thunder and lightning all over the earth for you
<BR>
	Nothing is too good for you
<P>
	I'll turn into an animal drive myself crazy
<BR>
	Light up like a bomb just to feel you
<BR>
	I'll sail submarines across the line of death
<BR>
	I'll give up my god just to heal you
<BR>
	Now I'm reading your mind and I know you're behind
<BR>
	The freedom I feel to surrender
<BR>
	And it's stronger than lust, more exotic than trust
<BR>
	I will prove that my love has no limits
<P>
	(It's love)  I'll change myself for you
<BR>
	(It's love)  And there's nothing that I wouldn't do
<BR>
	(It's love)  I will explode for you
<BR>
	Thunder and lightning, fire and ice
<BR>
	Money and fighting all over the earth for you
<BR>
	Nothing is too good for you
<P>
	(The prophecy says that when all hope is gone the real
<BR>
	 fun will finally begin   Now I'm losing myself in your
<BR>
	 beautiful hell while I'm dreaming up bigger better
<BR>
	 more original sins   If this is rehearsal for the end
<BR>
	 of the world then I'm hopeful   that you'll recognize
<BR>
	 me as the man of your dreams and the father of all your angels)
<P>
	(It's love)  I'll change myself for you
<BR>
	(It's love)  And there's nothing that I wouldn't do
<BR>
	(It's love)  I will explode for you
<BR>
	Thunder and lightning, fire and ice
<BR>
	Money and fighting all over the earth for you
<BR>
	Nothing is ever tabu
