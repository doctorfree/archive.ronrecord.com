<P>
	Last night i awoke, 
<BR>
	the scent of you snapping me out of
<BR>
	gray-paved dreams of desire and fear.
<P>
	Your hair curved gently over your shoulder,
<BR>
	face smiling in repose upon the pillow.
<BR>
	The smell of redbud blossoms wafted through the window.
<P>
	I could sense the perfection of quietude and peace
<BR>
	bestowed upon us by rain, wind and fortune.
<BR>
	Memories of the previous day's stroll through the gardens
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	were fresh and colorful in my mind.
<P>
	I ran my hand slowly over the curve of your arm,
<BR>
	felt the warmth of your hand.
<BR>
	You stirred and i kissed your cheek.
<P>
	Sleep came, your presence with me in dream.
<BR>
	Waking to the buzzing of alarm and heat of mid-morning,
<BR>
	I rolled to hold you.
<P>
	Gradually, the Lie dawned on my obstinate heart.
<BR>
	Mind-numbing startlization hurling me forward,
<BR>
	gut-wrenching realization pounding me downward.
<P>
	Your Absence not just an early awakening.
<BR>
	The quiet love of last night, not real, but
<BR>
	an imagined glimmer of what could or should have been.
<P>
	Had i slipped into this world or out of it last night ?
<BR>
	Was it really true, this awful lie, this world
<BR>
	in which our love is not ?
<P>
	Driving to work, a nauseous awareness sickening my soul.
<BR>
	People, in love with themselves. People, in love with their power.
<BR>
	People, in love with their cars, feeding off love.
<P>
	Our perfect love in another world.
<BR>
	Consumed in this one.
<BR>
	Internally combusted and filling the air with vapid vapors.
<P>
	Returning home, i tremble in bed.
<BR>
	Fearing the un-reality of dreams,
<BR>
	desiring only return to the glimpsed perfection.
<P>	
	I await resurrection,
<BR>
	recalling the mixture of shadow and light
<BR>
	which, for a few moments, was you.
<P>
