<P>
Oh! Wheeled wonder! Spoked splendor!
<BR>Thine seat is a throne, thine pedals a home.
<BR>Thou annointest me with the dignity of sweat
<BR>And bestow upon me strength, stamina, and breath.
<P>
Oh, how sweet the scent of thy pathways!
<BR>Clinging quietly to lane and levee,
<BR>Stealing stealthily past home and factory,
<BR>'Tis from the bosom of thy frame that i drink.
<P>
Oh, bike, i find myself in thee and thee in me.
<BR>My days are made full and my nights rest full because of thee.
<BR>Mine hands are filled with pleasure at thy touch.
<P>
Yeah, toil and struggle are rewarded with view and downhill.
<BR>'Tis by thine hand that vile gaseous vapors vend no more.
<BR>Yes, the birds of the air and fishes of the sea thank thee.
<P>
Unto thee i come daily and in sleep i dream of thee.
<BR>Know thee me not ?
<BR>Hast thou not delivered me lo these years ?
<P>
Ah, sweet bicycle, companion of my youth
<BR>Thou hast remained true and i have not forgotten how.
<BR>As i have grown and changed, so too have you.
<P>
So let us don our helmets with anticipation,
<BR>And strap our leggings with glee
<BR>As once more we set out on the journey begun in youth
<BR>Astride the elegant efficiency of thee.
