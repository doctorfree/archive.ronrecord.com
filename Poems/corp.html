  Heat shimmers from the cars
  Around my parking place;
  They all want my job.


  Ponderous, the glacial ice
  Flows still faster than
  My corporation.


  Savor a deadline;
  it is merely an excuse
  to stay up all night.


  A marketing bird!
  He tells me, tells me, and then
  tells me what he told me.


  Sunset is never
  ensnared in a choice between
  cost and quality.


  Fields of white daisies
  Now stained by fresh blood --
  Our offsite meeting has failed.
