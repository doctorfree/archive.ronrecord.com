<P>
	Full moon skiddin' cross the scud in the sky
<BR>
	Mud blood guts and beer spillin' on the rye
<P>
	Hot tub hair a hangin' like moss from a tree
<BR>
	Smells like Texas clear up to my knee
<P>
	Mouth harp's a whinin' 'bout a girl back home
<BR>
	Pianer player's tears clean the ivory bone
<P>
	Feller from Cleveland's got some stinkin' weed
<BR>
	Smokes it in the bathroom and it hasn't got a seed
<P>
	Drinkin' and a thinkin' and a prancin' and a dancin'
<BR>
	Tryin' to rope a heifer's like gamblin' and a chancin'
<P>
	Barkeep says he's gotta close up tight
<BR>
	Take it home, try tomorrow, don't get in a fight
<P>
	Headin' down the highway, headlights on the moon
<BR>
	Thinkin' 'bout movin' to Montana in june
<P>
	In bed all alone i turn the lights down dim
<BR>
	Roller coaster rivers take me for a swim
<P>
	Dreamin' of a Dallas whore sittin' on the throne
<BR>
	The whole damn world wants to hear her moan
<P>
	"Gimme mud an' gimme blood and gimme guts an' beer"
<BR>
	She shouts it out atop the pot for all the world to hear
<P>
	But when she pulls the handle, the bathroom starts to shake
<BR>
	Walls are a crumblin', it's a California quake
<P>
	Wake up in a sweat, got a tear in my eye
<BR>
	Full moon skiddin' cross the scud in the sky
<P>
