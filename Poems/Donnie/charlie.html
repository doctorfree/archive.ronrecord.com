My name is Charlie Chernobyl
And I've got something you really need
Clean, cheap energy
Sure to satisfy your greed
   
But, I must admit today
I've got problems that may get in the way
Any system I propose
I always find new holes

But....

  Something will turn up
   Just you wait and see
    That's what we all say
     The army, the government, and me

       Something will turn up
        Hang around and see
         If we can't find a place to dump
          We'll dump it in the sea

                         Get it out of your cranium
                  Because I've got power and I've got pigs
                             Guarding my uranium

Freeing all your fears
Of slowing down the techno-gears
Platonium can pull the pace
Assure the race a golden age

Think of the glitter
And the glory in the years ahead
Just don't you worry
And remember what your uncle Charlie said

He said...

  Something will turn up
   Just you wait and see
    That's what we all say
     The army, the government, and me

       Something will turn up
        Hang around and see
         If we can't find a place to dump
          We'll dump it in the sea
          We'll dump it in the sea
          We'll dump it in the sea
