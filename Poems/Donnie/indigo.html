                              "The Indigo Girl"
                                      by Don Record
                                      c 1986
Once upon a lifetime
When dreams are unfurled
You're dancing in the moonlight
With the Indigo Girl

Following a white line
You fly down the road
Following a roadsign 
Toward the indigo glow

When will I unwind?
When will I know?
She's on my mind
But I just don't let it show

Following a white line
You fly down the road
Following a roadsign
Toward the indigo glow

Where?
Where
   is
     she?
Where's
   the
    love?
The one they say is meant to be

All my friends just tell me
Live for now............
But I've forgotten how

Crimson embers                       
Of a fire that will die
But me and Indigo 
Burn on in the night

And every touch     
Will move us further up stream
The rivers that rush
Inside my indigo dream
