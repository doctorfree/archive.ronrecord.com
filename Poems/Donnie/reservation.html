		"Reservation"          
		by Don Record

Stuck out here on this reservation
Dancin' Eagle, he can't fight back anymore
Stumblin' around at the railroad station
Dancin' Eagle can't dance
Cause he's passed out on the floor

We see him out here most every evenin' 
He's always got a bottle in his hand
He comes walkin' in town like a chieftain
But he winds up in the county jail
For tryin to make just one last stand

But walkin' across this dusty field
  And searchin' the sky for his sacred shield
	Mighty Brotherhood
	  The whiteman's word's no good
		If he can't make a deal 
		  You know he'll steal

					   And he feels such frustration
				  You know he's got it achin' in his heart
					Climbin' the walls of his reservation

			  Allthough he's tried, still he just can't take it
			   The tribe broke up, still a few try to fake it
				   Livin' a lie and it's tearin' him apart

So he hangs around at the local drugstore 
Where all great heroes come to die and fade away
I remember how he'd dance up and down on the wood floors
Like an eagle dancin'
Up and down upon it's prey

Stuck out here on this reservation
And Dancin' Eagle, he can't fight back anymore
Stumblin' around at the railroad station
Dancin' Eagle can't dance 
Cause he's passed out on the floor
Dancin' Eagle can't dance 
Cause he's passed out on the floor
