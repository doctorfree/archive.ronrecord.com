                               "Multiplan Man"

Working 8 to 5
Just trying to survive
With no place I can scream

I climb the spiral stairs
To the office in the air
And the spacy daydreams

Of the                   
  Multiplan man
  With all the bureaucratic blues
  He'll never understand
  I've got nothing on my mind

  A paper man
  Just a photostatic copy
  Of another man
  I'm working overtime

Is it the boredom and the dues
Of the games I win and lose
That make my hair turn grey?

Is it the shine on my shoes
Or this breifcase full of boos
That get me through the day

Of the
  Paper Man
  Just a photostatic copy
  Of any other man
  I've got Nothing on my mind

  The Multiplan Man
  With all the bureaucratic blues
  He'll never understand
  I'm working overtime

                       Give me the gas to get me home
                      Give me a joint and get me stoned
                         Here at last I'm all alone
                             Waiting another day
                        Wired, tired, and I'm cloned

Working 8 to 5
With my eyes on the sky
And my feet on the ground

I climb the spiral stairs
To the office in the air
And I don't come down

I am
  The Multiplan Man
  Just a photostatic copy
  Of another man
  I've got nothing on my mind

  Just a grain of sand
  Along the bureaucratic beaches
  And the surreal strand
  I'm working overtime
