                           "The Dunce is Dancing"
                                      by Don Record

Ooo, what a funny, funny little man
Doing things no one can understand

   All mouths drop, all eyes are open wide
   But nobody knows what goes on inside


       Smiling at the world as it passes him by
       I've never seen him laugh, never seen him cry

             He seems so pleased to be so simplified
             But nobody knows what goes on inside

                            The dunce is dancing
                         And he always wears a smile
                           I guess if you gotta go
                         You oughta go out in style

                            The dunce is dancing
                        Like he's got nothing to hide
                              But nobody knows
                                  nobody knows
                                  nobody knows what goes on inside
                    
Everybody laughed when he danced like a fool
Dancing all alone 'till his face turned blue
  
   Wild and innocent foolish pride
   But nobody knows what goes on inside

       Finally we all went our separate ways
       Suddenly "The Dunce" was a new dance craze
      
            Abandoned abdomens electrified
            Nobody knows what goes on inside

                            The dunce is dancing
                         And he always wears a smile
                           I guess if you gotta go
                         You oughta go out in style

                            The dunce is dancing
                        Like he's got nothing to hide
                              But nobody knows
                                  nobody knows
                                  nobody knows what goes on inside

Ooo, what a funny, funny little man...
