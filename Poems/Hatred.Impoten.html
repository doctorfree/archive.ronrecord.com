<P>
	I very nearly called you last night.
<BR>
	A desire to flail you with words possessed me.
<BR>
	Perhaps if i poured my anger over you
<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like scalding water on a bed of ashes,
<BR>
	You'd rise to life in a cloud of steam
<P>
	I stopped myself.
<BR>
	Fearing romantic infection
<BR>
	Seeking un-dreamt resurrection
<BR>
	Hiding within my own imperfection
<P>
	My anger with you is elusive
<BR>
	It slips from my grasp
<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just as it reaches the heat of action.
<BR>
	If i could hold it within me
<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for just one more hour,
<BR>
	The reflections of rejections and corrections
<BR>
	Could burn the scars of scorn -
<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cauterize derision's incisions
<BR>
	Implode the black heart of disgust.
<P>
	I confess, my hatred for you is impotent.
<BR>
	It is bathed and beaten from me
<BR>
	By the blazing beauty
<BR>
	Of the image you left
<BR>
	Of yourself in me.
<P>
	I love that shining face.
