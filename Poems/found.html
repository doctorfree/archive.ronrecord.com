A jilted English bride
<BR>
who lived in her garden
<BR>
for 35 years
<BR>
after being abandoned
<BR>
by her fiance
<BR>
was found dead
<BR>
over the weekend.
<P>
Joan Abery,
<BR>
70,
<BR>
refused to go back
<BR>
into her house
<BR>
after being spurned
<BR>
at the church.
<P>
She built herself
<BR>
a shelter
<BR>
from trees, twigs
<BR>
and brightly colored umbrellas
<BR>
in the front garden
<BR>
of her home
<BR>
and furnished it
<BR>
with car seats
<BR>
and briefcases.
<P>
She had left her house
<BR>
in southern England
<BR>
unchanged
<BR>
since the day
<BR>
the wedding
<BR>
should have
<BR>
taken
<BR>
place
