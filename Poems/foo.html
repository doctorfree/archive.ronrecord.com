<P>
I snuck into the holiest of holies
<P>
To write this poem for you
<BR>
Like a tatoo
<BR>
A permanently etched scrawling requiring laser surgery, maybe, to remove
<BR>
A permanently enscribed scribbling expressing my admiration and love for you
<BR>
An admiration denied expression. A love denied trial.
<P>
Our praying mantis love
<BR>
You snapping off my head with your jaws
<BR>
Me idiotically and obliviously continuing to pump into you
<BR>
Two sticky stuck dragonflies not knowing our love had ended long ago
<P>
I performed open heart surgery on myself
<BR>
Scraping out the remains of my love for you
<BR>
Cleaning out the virus you left lodged in my valves
<BR>
I super-glued my broken heart and closed the chest cavity over it for good
<P>
You took your wings off
<BR>
And i lost mine
<BR>
Falling twin towers exploding
<BR>
Shoveling the rubble and remembrances
<P>
Here is my uncensored love song gone wrong. 
<BR>
Here is my love poem abortion for you.
