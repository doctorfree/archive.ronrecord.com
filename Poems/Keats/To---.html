	What can I do to drive away
	Remembrance from my eyes? for they have seen,
	Aye, an hour ago, my brilliant queen!
	Touch has a memory. O say, love, say,
	What can I do to kill it and be free
	In my old liberty?
	When every fair one that I saw was fair,
	Enough to catch me in but half a snare,
	Not keep me there:
	When, howe'er poor or particolored things,
	My muse had wings,
	And ever ready was to take her course
	Whither I bent her force,
	Unintellectual, yet divine to me; --
	Divine, I say! -- What seabird o'er the sea
	Is a philosopher the while he goes 
	Winging along where the great water throes?

		How shall I do
		To get anew
	Those molted feathers, and so mount once more
		Above, above
		The reach of fluttering Love,
	And make him cower lowly while i soar?
	Shall I gulp wine? No, that is vulgarism,
	A heresy and schism,
		Foisted into the canon law of love; --
	No -- wine is only sweet to happy men;
		More dismal cares
		Seize on me unawares --
	Where shall I learn to get my peace again?
	To banish thoughts of that most hateful land,
	Dungeoner of my friends, that wicked strand
	Where they were wrecked and live a wrecked life;
	That monstrous region, whose dull rivers pour,
	Ever from their sordid urns unto the shore,
	Unowned of any weedy-haired gods;
	Whose winds, all zephyrless, hold scourging rods,
	Iced in the great lakes, to afflict mankind;
	Whose rank-grown forests, frosted, black, and blind,
	Would fright a Dryad; whose harsh herbaged meads
	Make lean and lank the starved ox while he feeds;
	There bad flowers have no scent, birds no sweet song,
	And great unerring nature once seems wrong.

	O, for some sunny spell
	To dissipate the shadows of this hell!
	Say they are gone -- with the new dawning light
	Steps forth my lady bright!
	O, let me once more rest
	My soul upon that dazzling breast!
	Let once again these aching arms be placed,
	The tender gaolers of thy waist!
	And let me feel that warm breath here and there
	To spread a rapture in my very hair --
	O, the sweetness of the pain!
	Give me those lips again!
	Enough! Enough! it is enough for me
	To dream of thee!
