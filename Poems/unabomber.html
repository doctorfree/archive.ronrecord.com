    Technology bad
<BR>
    Please tell me you like my beard
<BR>
    Or I'll blow you up
<P>
    Fun, easygoing
<BR>
    single, white Unabomber
<BR>
    seeks same for love, laughs.
<P>
    Farewell to tenure
<BR>
    Sniping from the tower clock
<BR>
    already been done
<P>
    Should I comb my hair
<BR>
    Or should I wear it matted
<BR>
    Judge prefers it combed
<P>
    Remember when you
<BR>
    Laughed at his fake fur parka?
<BR>
    He remembers, too.
<P>
    My Daddy said BANG
<BR>
    When he taught me about sex.
<BR>
    I misunderstood.
<P>
    Ted's fate worse than death:
<BR>
    "You're assigned to prison shop.
<BR>
    Make computer chips."
  <P>       
    Do you like my beard?
<BR>
    Please tell me you like my beard
<BR>
    Or I'll blow you up
    <P>     
    Machines done ruined
<BR>
    Western Civilization
<BR>
    Think I'll mail some bombs
      <P>   
    I have a vision
<BR>
    But I am misunderstood
<BR>
    Do you like my beard?
    <P>     
    Option: Suicide
<BR>
    Perhaps I'll send a letter
<BR>
    To myself in jail
      <P>   
    Harvard boy--upset.
<BR>
    Didn't get the attention
<BR>
    Of upper class chicks
<P>         
    Ed McMahon of Death
<BR>
    You may already be a
<BR>
    Winner! Open me!
  <P>       
    Bad Unabomber!
<BR>
    Blowing people all to hell.
<BR>
    Do you take requests?
    <P>     
    Why can't I get this
<BR>
    Stupid computer to print?
<BR>
    Time to buy some stamps.
      <P>   
    Manifesto. Oops.
<BR>
    What a giveaway. Next time
<BR>
    No windy essays
<P>         
    Kind of ironic
<BR>
    Hates technology lots but
<BR>
    Has two typewriters
  <P>       
    Remember when you
<BR>
    Laughed at his fake fur parka?
<BR>
    He remembers, too.
    <P>     
    "Open your present..."
<BR>
    "No, you open your present..."
<BR>
    Kaczinski Christmas
    <P>     
    I was your math prof.
<BR>
    You made fun of my weird ways.
<BR>
    It was all your fault.
      <P>   
    It's circumstantial
<BR>
    All that stuff in my cabin
<BR>
    I found it all--yeah
        <P> 
    How irritable
<BR>
    I've become, wiping my butt
<BR>
    With leaves and tree bark.
   <P>
