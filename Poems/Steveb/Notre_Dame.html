Notre Dame
<P>
From the days of long ago
<BR>
Comes a legend evertold
<BR>
Of a woman of the moon
<P>

From the halls of ancient Tyre
<BR>
Comes a mystery of desire
<BR>
Love for the lady of the throne
<P>

Sweet Maria
<BR>
Lady of the light
<BR>
Lady Sophia
<BR>
Sweet wisdom of the night
<BR>
Sweet Maria
<BR>
Lady of the vine
<BR>
Lady Sophia
<BR>
Sweet blood of time
<P>

Like the gypsies on the coast
<BR>
Who saw the light and held it close
<BR>
Ave Marie de la Mer
<P>

And like the troubadours of old
<BR>
Who whispered soft but sang out bold
<BR>
They told a story of a lady Notre Dame
<P>

Sweet Maria
<BR>
Lady of the light
<BR>
Lady Sophia
<BR>
Sweet wisdom of the night
<BR>
Sweet Maria
<BR>
Lady of the vine
<BR>
Lady Sophia
<BR>
Sweet blood of time
<P>

Like a star across the land
<BR>
They carved her name into the sand
<BR>
A holy vision of our lady Notre Dame
<P>

Her face was dark as night
<BR>
She lay hidden from the light
<BR>
Sweet Madonna Notre Dame
<P>

Sweet Maria
<BR>
Lady of the light
<BR>
Lady Sophia
<BR>
Sweet wisdom of the night
<BR>
Sweet Maria
<BR>
Lady of the vine
<BR>
Lady Sophia
<BR>
Sweet blood of time
<P>

And they built their sweeping towers
<BR>
Tried to capture her red flower
<BR>
Holy of holies Notre Dame
<P>

Now the Dark Ages have come
<BR>
The holy vision come undone
<BR>
Where does she sleep sweet Notre Dame
<P>

Sweet Maria
<BR>
Lady of the light
<BR>
Lady Sophia
<BR>
Sweet wisdom of the night
<BR>
Sweet Maria
<BR>
Lady of the vine
<BR>
Lady Sophia
<BR>
Sweet blood of time
<P>
