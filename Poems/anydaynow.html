<PRE>
    Any day now, that ship's coming in
    Our bad luck will change, storm clouds will break

        Pretty soon now, our stars will align
        Warm Sun on our face, Heaven's embrace

            Hold your head up
                Keep your hips cocked
            Stay on your toes
                Bend at the knee
            Keep your eyes peeled
                Ear to the ground

    Any day now, the King will step down
    Flood waters recede, blue skies appear

        Pretty soon now, God will smite our foes
        He'll deliver us, Victorious!

            Hold your chin up
                Keep your head down
            And with your nose
                To the grindstone
            By your bootstraps
                Pull yourself up

    Any day now, she'll come back to me
    Arms open and glad, warm happy home

        Pretty soon now, her lips will kiss mine
        Our souls will find grace, our love divine

            Hold your head up
                Keep your hips cocked
            Stay on your toes
                Bend at the knee
            Keep your eyes peeled
                Ear to the ground

    Any day now, the band will unite
    Brothers and Sisters, we'll win the fight

        Pretty soon now, the stage will be set
        A beach of white sand, rested and tanned

            Hold your chin up
                Keep your head down
            And with your nose
                To the grindstone
            By your bootstraps
                Pull yourself up
