Medicine Story came to a tall white Pueblo standing on a spot where many
paths came together. The Pueblo was wearing a belt and Spirit Messages 
moved around the belt in a circle. At one point on the belt new Spirit
Messages were born and old ones died. Medicine Story stared at that point,
raised his arms and held his bundle. The Spirit Messages on the belt
started to tell his story.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They showed his father, Wise Coyote, and his mother,
Quiet Moon.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They showed his father and mother telling him
that he was to go on a journey, and they showed him walking over great
plains and high mountains, and swimming Great Rivers.

and the Spirit World. And they showed Medicine Story bowing in respect
to the Spirits.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Spirits around the Pueblo gazed at the
belt on the Pueblo in fascination. Then they saw Medicine Story bow to
the Pueblo and walk off.
