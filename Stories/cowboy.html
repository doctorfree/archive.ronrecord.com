While growing up on the East side of Enid, Oklahoma, I had the opportunity
to attend Adams Elementary School with the Allen family. The Allens were
full-blood Native Americans and their two boys, Cowboy and Floyd, also

the East Side and every day at recess he and his brother Floyd would position
themselves strategically under a row of crabapple trees. From this vantage
point they would pummel the other students with rock-hard crabapples. Recess
at Adams Elementary became a lesson in survival. Many years later, while
hopping freight one morning I saw this spray painted on the side of a 
box car:
