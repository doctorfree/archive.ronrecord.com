In or around 1975 i was living outside Gainesville, Florida. I had been
studying yoga out of the book "Integral Hatha Yoga" by 
<A HREF=http://yogaville.org/guru.htm>Swami Satchidananda</A>. He was the
funny little Swami who appeared at Woodstock and his book was full of pretty
good pictures of the poses. I just imitated the pictures. Well, one day
i heard Swami Satchidananda was coming to speak in Orlando which is maybe
150 miles south of Gainesville.
<P>
I had hitched back and forth across North America several times and figured
this little jaunt would be easy. So, i started out in the morning with my
shoulder bag, oranges, bread and my flute. Satchidananda wasn't speaking
until 8 that night so i was just planning on having a pleasant day hitching.
<P>
Along about mid-afternoon i realized i had travelled only 30 miles or so
and i had been sitting in one spot for hours. I began to thumb in ernest.
Cars were whizzing by me like i was invisible. Around 5 i started to panic.
Around 6 i started yelling at passing motorists in anger. I just couldn't
believe people could be so cruel as to cause me to miss my guru, my teacher.
<P>
I finally made it to the talk around 8 or 9. Exhausted and emotionally drained
i attempted to slip quietly into the lecture room. Just as i entered the Swami
looked up directly at me, smiled with those twinkling eyes of his and said
<P>
<CENTER>
"<B><I>Make no appointments and you'll have no disappointments</I></B>"!
</CENTER>
<P>
I couldn't believe it. It seemed like the entire day had been one long
arduous lesson which Satchidananda was able to sum up in 8 words. That lesson
really stuck with me and i've pretty much lived my life by it. It's usually
stated more along the lines of having no expectations but i like the Swami's
rhyme better. Thanks, man.
