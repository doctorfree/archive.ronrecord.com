I attended Enid High School in Enid, Oklahoma where i grew up.
As a kid i used to hang out at the Trail bowling alley, play
pinball and bowl. I got fairly good and during high school i
continued to bowl competitively. I graduated from high
school and lost interest in bowling. That year when i started
college at Phillips University (also in Enid) i told Hoss (the
owner and manager of the Trail) that he could have my ball, shoes
and bag - maybe pass them on to some up-and-coming kid. Anyway,
i just left them there in my locker in the Trail bowling alley
in Enid, Oklahoma.
<P>
I attended Phillips for 4 years, got my B.A. in Political Science
and moved to Gainesville, Florida to attend the University of
Florida as a graduate student in Mathematics. I studied Math for
a couple of years, had a great time, got fired as a T.A. (another
story), dropped out of school and became a street person. I slept
under bushes or in tree houses or camped out at springs. My favorite
place to stay was a park in a residential section of Gainesville that
had loads of Azelias. I'd sleep under the Azelia bushes and read
science fiction by candlelight. This was 6 or 7 years after having
graduated from Enid High School and 2 or 3 years after having moved
1500 miles from Enid to Gainesville.
<P>
Well, one Winter night in Gainesville it was cold and rainy. I was
uncomfortable under the Azelias that night (tho they usually kept
me pretty dry). So, i went scouting for a warm dry place to sleep.
Walking around the neighborhood i spotted an abandoned three-story
Victorian. Managing to jimmy the lock on the back door, i climbed
the stairs to the third floor and found an octagon shaped room with
a cushioned bench and windows on three sides. I lit a candle and
lo and behold, there was a book in the room. It was a copy of Hiawatha
by Longfellow and, as i opened it to read a twenty dollar bill fell out!
Man, was i happy. I really needed the money to wash my clothes and
the book was an excellent read in the warm dry comfortable old room.
<P>
Next morning as i woke i really gave thanks to that house. Even tho the
park was comfortable most nights, you never really get a good nights rest
sleeping outside in America as the cops are constantly hassling folks.
I felt like i had slept for days. I decided to explore around the house
a bit to see if there were any other magic surprises hidden within.
<P>
The place was pretty empty. No furniture, no nothing. Except for some
boxes stored under the bottom flight of stairs. I started pulling these
boxes out and looking through them. Nothing interesting, mostly just old
accounting documents, bills and papers concerning the house. I pulled
the last box out and there, hidden behind it, was a bowling bag. It looked
like my old bowling bag - black with a purple diagonal stripe. I unzipped
it and pulled out the bowling ball and, sure enough, it was my old ball
with my name on it and everything!
<P>
I was dumbfounded. I didn't know what to do. I certainly couldn't haul a
sixteen pound ball around with me as a street person. I wasn't good enough
to be a professional bowler. What the heck did this mean? I just couldn't
believe it. This was over 6 years and 1500 miles from where i'd left it.
Even if someone had brought it out to Florida maybe to return it to me or
something, it was mindboggling that i would find it by breaking into an
abandoned house in the rain.
<P>
I just left it there. To this day i'm amazed. When i tell my friends and
family this story they're all amazed (they believe me cause it's the truth
and i'm not known as a tall-tail-teller). Nobody can explain this. It's
an unbelievably unlikely coincedence with little or no great spiritual
lesson or meaning. Just one of God's little jokes - i guess it must get
pretty boring watching us scurry around making much ado about nothing.
