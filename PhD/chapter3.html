<B>Chapter 3  Interactive Run-time Control<!--Chapter 3 - Interactive
Control--></B><!--Interactive control-->
<P>
<B>3.1 Playing with the title screen and demo<!--3.1 Title screen
and demo--></B>
<P>
If <B>endo</B> is invoked with no arguments, a title screen is
displayed. The full-screen window welcomes. In the center of the
screen a graphic is displayed. At the bottom of the screen are
instructions for use of the program. The user can choose to allow
<B>endo</B> to randomly demonstrate some of its features or continue
on to the menu of maps. If the user wants to proceed on, she can
press the space bar or click any mouse button. If she decides
to watch the demo, several keys provide limited interactive control.

<P>
Pressing the 'n' key causes <B>endo</B> to go on to the next demo,
'p' the previous demo. The 'w' key installs another color palette.
Pressing 'q' quits the program.
<P>
<B>3.2 Selecting a map and view<!--3.2 Selecting a map and view
--></B><!--Mapselection-->
<P>
The menu of maps presents the user with a list of the available
maps, the current settings for settle<!--Settle--> and dwell<!--Dwell
-->, and a list of the views. This screen and the title screen
are not displayed if the &quot;<B>-T #</B>&quot; option was present.
Click the left mouse button to select the desired map. The selected
map will be highlighted. Clicking the right and left mouse buttons
in the settle<!--Settle--> or dwell<!--Dwell--> areas of the screen
will increase and decrease the values. Clicking the left mouse
button in the view areas to the right of the screen will toggle
the selection of those views. Pressing the space bar or clicking
the right mouse button will bring up the selected views and begin
the iterations.
<P>
<B>3.3 The information and help windows<!--3.3 The information
and help windows--></B><!--Information and help-->
<P>
The display of an &quot;information&quot; window can be toggled
by pressing ''. This window contains the map<!--Mapinformation
--> definition, parameter values currently selected, ranges of
the views selected and other data relevant to the map and views.
The information window will also display the modes that <B>endo
</B> is currently running in. For instance, whether critical curve
<!--Critical curvesinformation window--> detection is on, whether
periodic orbit detection is on, what level of &quot;Mandelbrot&quot;
mode has been selected and what the escape radius is.
<P>
The display of a &quot;help&quot; window can be toggled by pressing
'<B>h</B>' or '<B>?</B>'. This window contains a terse description
of the interactive run-time control available via the keyboard
and mouse. The information and help windows cannot be panned or
zoomed and are the only such windows.
<P>
<B>3.4 Zooming and panning<!--3.4 Zooming and panning--></B><!--Zooming
and panning-->
<P>
The mouse and/or keyboard can be used to zoom in, zoom out and
pan in any of the windows. To zoom in with the mouse, position
the cursor on the upper left corner of the desired zoom box. Click
and hold the left mouse button while rubber-banding a zoom box.
When the cursor is on the desired lower right corner, release
the left mouse button. The rubber-banded box expands to fill the
window.
<P>
To zoom out or pan the window, use the keyboard. Pressing the
'' key doubles the range of the x and y axes of a window while
keeping the center point fixed. This effectively quadruples the
area of the plane displayed in a window. Pressing the '' key reverses
this by zooming in by a factor of four while keeping the center
point fixed.
<P>
Panning can be accomplished by pressing the '<B>5</B>', '<B>6
</B>', '<B>7</B>' and '<B>8</B>' keys to pan left, right, down
and up respectively. Each key slides the window half of the respective
range, thus positioning the former center at an edge and a former
edge point at the center. 
<P>
<B>3.5 Toggling the views<!--3.5 Toggling the views--></B>
<P>
The several views of the dynamics provided in <B>endo</B> can
be displayed individually or in concert with one another. By default
the trajectory window is displayed along with either the basins
of attraction or the Lyapunov exponents. The display of the trajectory
<!--Trajectorytoggling the view--> window (also used to display
the bifurcation<!--Bifurcation--> diagrams) can be toggled interactively
by pressing the '' key. To toggle between the basin window and
the Lyapunov window, press '<B>L</B>'. The display of the critical
curve window is toggled via the '<B>C</B>' key and that of the
precritical curves<!--Critical curvestoggling display--> via the
'<B>N</B>' key. 
<P>
The trajectory<!--Trajectoryerasing--> window can be erased after
each individual trajectory has been displayed. The '<B>e</B>'
key toggles this feature. The trajectory window can be cleared
at any time by pressing '<B>c</B>'. Periodic trajectory<!--Trajectoryperiodic
--> detection is toggled by pressing the '<B>f</B>' key.
<P>
Several views of the bifurcation<!--Bifurcation--> diagrams are
provided. Pressing '<B>2</B>' steps through these views. By default,
the bifurcation view is non-erasing and displays the attractor
as a parameter value is changed over time. The next view presented
(after pressing '<B>2</B>' once) shows the x coordinate of the
trajectory<!--Trajectorybifurcation diagram--> on the attractor
(y-axis) plotted against a parameter (x-axis). The next view uses
the y-coordinate of the trajectory on the attractor and the final
view plots both x and y coordinates of the trajectory on the attractor
against a parameter axis. All of these views can be displayed
in &quot;animation&quot; mode in which the attractor is erased
each time the parameter is incremented.
<P>
The trajectory<!--Trajectoryin other views--> can be viewed in
other windows as well. In order to display the trajectory in the
critical curve<!--Critical curvestrajectory in window--> window,
press <B>&lt;ctrl&gt;-C</B>. To display the trajectory in either
the precritical or basin windows, press <B>&lt;ctrl&gt;-T</B>
or <B>&lt;ctrl&gt;-P</B>.
<P>
<B>3.6 Adjusting values<!--3.6 Adjusting values--></B>
<P>
Several runtime values can be changed interactively. The settle
<!--Settle--> and dwell<!--Dwell--> can be increased or decreased.
To double the settle, press '<B>]</B>'. To halve it, press '<B>[
</B>'. To double the dwell, press '<B>&gt;</B>'. To halve it,
press '<B>&lt;</B>'. Likewise, the values of  or  can be halved
by pressing '<B>{</B>' or '<B>-</B>' and doubled by pressing '
<B>}</B>' or '<B>+</B>' respectively. Recall, these values set
the near-periodic and critical curve<!--Critical curvescalculation
--> detection ranges.
<P>
<B>3.7 The color palettes and view enhancements<!--3.7 The color
palettes and view enhancements--></B>
<P>
Included with <B>endo</B> are 16 built-in color palettes and many
user-defined palettes to select from. To increment the color palette
index, press '<B>W</B>'. To decrement this index, press '<B>w
</B>'. The user-defined palette is palette index 0 and is defined
in the file <B>$HOME/.endomap.</B> Several samples of these files
are provided in the source distribution in the directory <B>lib/colormaps.
</B> The user is encouraged to play with the color maps provided
and create new ones. The author has found that quite often heretofore
unseen subtleties of the dynamics are strikingly revealed by use
of an alternate color map.
<P>
Several view enhancements are also provided. These include 3-D
bifurcation<!--Bifurcation--> diagram display, trajectory histogram
calculation and display, color bar indexing, color palette indexing
curves and critical arc location and display. The use of 3-D bifurcation
diagrams is toggled with the '<B>3</B>' key (if this feature was
turned on at compile time). The author, however, found that 3-D
enhancements to bifurcation diagrams was not as effective as use
of the '<B>e</B>' key to turn on the erasure of trajectories.
In this way, the bifurcation diagram is displayed a slice at a
time in a &quot;movie&quot; with time representing the parameter
axis.
<P>
The '<B>H</B>' key toggles trajectory histogram<!--Trajectoryhistogram
--> calculation. Although this feature requires additional memory
and cpu resources, it achieves a pleasing and appropriate coloration
of the attractor. The histographic display of an attractor essentially
represents a probability measure with colors representing densities.
A color bar showing the range used for the histogram can be displayed
by pressing <B>&lt;ctrl&gt;-B</B>. The color bar can be displayed
in either the lower-left or upper-left corners of the window.
Pressing <B>&lt;ctrl&gt;-O</B> toggles display between these two
corners.
<P>
The algorithm used to calculate the histographic display of the
trajectory<!--Trajectoryhistogram--> can be modified by pressing
<B>&lt;ctrl&gt;-V</B>. This brings up a window which displays
the mapping of histogram values to colors. This mapping can be
adjusted by use of the keyboard or mouse. Pressing <B>&lt;ctrl&gt;-[,
&lt;ctrl&gt;-], &lt;ctrl&gt;-^</B>, or <B>&lt;ctrl&gt;-_</B> will
move the intersection point left, right, upward or downward. The
intersection point can also be moved by &quot;grabbing&quot; and
&quot;dragging&quot; it with the mouse. To do this, click the
left mouse button and hold it down as you move it to the desired
intersection location. In addition to these adjustments, entirely
different histogram color mapping functions are available. To
step through these, press <B>&lt;ctrl&gt;-K</B> or <B>&lt;ctrl&gt;-L
</B> to decrement or increment the color mapping algorithm index.
<P>
<B>3.8 Saving to a file<!--3.8 Saving to a file--></B><!--Saving
to a file-->
<P>
Each of the five main <B>endo</B> windows can be saved to a file.
When calculating basins, the basin window is saved to a file by
pressing '<B>F</B>'. The '<B>F</B>' key is also used to save the
Lyapunov exponent window. To save the trajectory<!--Trajectorysaving
to a file--> window, press '<B>T</B>'. Pressing '<B>V</B>' or
'<B>v</B>' saves the critical or precritical curve windows respectively.
In each case, the file format is Portable Pixmap (PPM) for color
displays or Portable Bitmap (PBM) for monochrome displays. See
<B>2.9</B> for command-line arguments to specify the output filename.
<P>
<B>3.9 Restarting<!--3.9 Restarting--></B>
<P>
You may, at any time, return to either the title screen or menu
of maps<!--Mapselection--> by pressing '<B>J</B>' or '<B>S</B>'
respectively. In this way, you can re-initialize the view, parameters
and map or just view the title demo. If all you want to do is
change the map, this can be accomplished by pressing the '<B>m
</B>' key which increments the map index. Incrementing the map
index leaves all other parameters unchanged. Care should be exercised
to avoid invalid parameter ranges and initial conditions.
