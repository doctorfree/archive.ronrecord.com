<B>5.3 Theory<!--5.3 Theory--></B><!--Theory-->
<P>
The critical curves are used to define the domains of the inverses
of  T, determine the absorbing areas, and characterize the global
bifurcations. In order to do so, the properties of critical curves
and their iterates are used to develop a theory which characterizes
bifurcations in terms of the interaction of thecritical curves
with other geometric aspects of the dynamics such as the stable
and unstable sets of a saddle, the boundary of a basin of attraction
or the boundary of a chaotic area. Contacts between these and
other objects are indicative of a wide variety of bifurcations.
The procedures and algorithms used by <B>endo</B> are based on
this theory and useful in its further development.
<P>
The algorithm for determining an absorbing area is based on the
following procedure discovered by Mira. Let  be the point of intersection
of  and  ,  its preimage of rank 1 belonging to  and  the image
of rank i of . If  a positive integer m such that the critical
arc  intersects , use procedure 2. Otherwise, use procedure 1.
For instance, in the Dorband Double Logistic with , use procedure
1. For , use procedure 2.
<P>
Procedure 1: Let  be a point of  such that  and a critical arc
 intersects  at . Then the area  with boundary  is an absorbing
area. 
<P>
Procedure 2: Let m be the first integer such that the critical
arc  intersects  and let  be the intersection point furthest from
. Then the area  with boundary  is an absorbing area.

<B>5.4 An Example<!--5.4 An Example--></B><!--Example-->
<P>
Consider the family of two dimensional maps <I>T: R</I>2<I>R</I>2,
(<I>x,y</I>)(<I>x',y'</I>) as a function of a real parameter 
defined by :
<P>
 . 
<P>
This &quot;double logistic&quot; map can be considered as a model
for a coupled pair of oscillators. The fixed points of <I>T</I>
and their local stability can be calculated by solving the equation
 then calculating the eigenvalues at each fixed point. Varying
the parameter , we divide the dynamical behavior into five &quot;regimes&quot;.
For a complete treatment of this example, see Gardini, L., R.H.
Abraham, R. J. Record, D. Fournier-Prunaret, [1994] &quot;A Double
Logistic Map&quot;, <U>International Journal of Bifurcation and
Chaos</U>, Vol. 4, No. 1, 145-176<B>.</B>
<P>
Behavior in the first regime, 0.0 &lt;  &lt; 0.2, is characterized
by a simply connected basin of attraction. There are fixed points
on the diagonal, , at the origin, O = (0,0) and S* = (3/4, 3/4).
There are fixed points off the diagonal at =() and =(). The origin
is a saddle for (0,0.4) and a repelling node for &gt;0.4 while
S* is a saddle for (0,0.66...) and a repelling node for &gt;0.66...
.   are attracting foci for (0,0.4) and repelling foci for &gt;0.4
. The stable set of the origin, Ws(O), consists of two arcs connecting
O and its &quot;alternate&quot; inverse O-1 .
<P>
In the second regime, 0.2 &lt;  &lt; 0.4, the basin of attraction
is no longer simply connected but consists of an infinite number
of simply connected components  . At =0.2 a global basin bifurcation
occurs characterized by the contact of the critical curve  with
the backward invariant sets <I>Ws(O)</I> and <I>Ws(S*).</I> <I>Z4
</I> penetrates the basin of attraction <I>D. Ws(S*),</I> which
determines <I>D</I>(), has a more complex structure, containing
infinitely many arcs.
<P>
The third regime, 0.4 &lt;  &lt; *  0.70209, is initiated at =0.4
with a flip bifurcation of the origin and a Neimark-Hopf bifurcation
of the fixed points  and . The attracting foci each give rise
to an attracting closed invariant curve i , i=1,2. The origin
bifurcates from a saddle to a repelling node. A repelling 2-cycle
saddle appears on the formerly attracting branch of the saddle
at the origin. Construction of the absorbing area is now possible
using the procedure developed by Mira and outlined above.
<P>
Inside the third regime at    0.487At 0.487 a critical arc  becomes
tangent to and  an annular absorbing area (<I>AAA</I>) appears.
While  is not a snap-back repellor,  a simply connected  absorbing
area <I>d</I>' and a <I>AAA da'</I> with  =  and  =  where : {

<P>
At   = 1  0.48735 the invariant attracting curve  becomes tangent
to  .  is deformed from a smooth oval  by the appearance of oscillations
as a result of the &quot;folding&quot; of the portion of  above
 . At   = 2  0.505 the invariant attracting curve  becomes tangent
to <I>LC</I> (crossing  at the two points  and ). After the crossing
 will be tangent to <I>LC</I> at two points separated by  . Contact
between the chaotic attractor and its basin boundary at   0.64218
produces a &quot;contact bifurcation&quot;.
<P>
 <I>S</I>*=(3/4, 3/4) bifurcates from a saddle to a repelling
node at   = 0.66... . Along the diagonal , <I>S</I>* bifurcates
from attracting to repelling while spawning a 2-cycle, <I>Q1-Q2
</I>, attracting on  but repelling in the orthogonal direction
(i.e. <I>Q1-Q2</I> is a 2-cycle saddle for T)
<P>
The fourth regime is the parameter interval *  0.70209    0.1
. At =*an arc of the critical curve  on the boundary of the <I>AAA
</I> becomes tangent to  at the periodic point <I>Q</I>1, causing
the reunion of the two disjoint annular chaotic areas into a single
connected chaotic area
<P>
The hole <I>H(S*)</I> disappears at the SBR bifurcation of <I>S*
</I> occurring at  = s  0.714 .The two symmetric rank-1 preimages
of <I>S*</I> outside  fall on the boundary of d' and thus on an
arc of a critical curve. All the critical curves <I>LCi</I>, i3,
pass through <I>S*.</I> Infinitely many homoclinic orbits of 
<I>S*</I> exist and persist after the SBR bifurcation for all
values of  &gt; s .
<P>
The SBR bifurcation of the fixed points  and  occurs at  = p 
0.737 . After this bifurcation , the holes <I>H</I>() and <I>H
</I>() disappear and the chaotic area d coincides with d' and
is simply connected. This bifurcation is characterized by the
critical curves ,  passing through the fixed points  and  .
<P>
At    0.7596 there is a pitchfork bifurcation of the 2-cycle saddle
<I>R1-R2</I> which becomes a repelling node and spawns the appearance
of a couple of 2-cycle saddles on the Frontier. There is also
a pitchfork bifurcation of the 2-cycle saddle <I>Q1-Q2</I> on
 which becomes an attracting node.
<P>
At 0.84 an 8-cycle undergoes a Neimark-Hopf bifurcation giving
rise to 8 closed invariant curves. At 0.845 contact bifurcations
produce a 4-cyclic annular chaotic area. At 0.852 an SBR bifurcation
gives rise to a 4-cyclic chaotic area, not annular. At 0.854 a
contact bifurcation between the 4 basins of attraction and the
4-cyclic chaotic areas produces a single chaotic attractor in
the absorbing area d'. This sequence is repeated for the attracting
4-cycle  which occurs at =0.88 .
<P>
The SBR bifurcation of <I>S*</I> for occurs when the two critical
curves  and  intersect  at the fixed point <I>S*</I> at   0.8928
. Prior to this, all the points homoclinic to <I>S*</I> in <I>d
</I>' were outside . After, there are points homoclinic to <I>S*
</I> in .
<P>
The last contact bifurcation of <I>d'</I> occurs at =1.0, a homoclinic
bifurcation in which the origin becomes an SBR. In this, the fifth
regime,  for &gt;1.0, the point at infinity is the unique attractor.
In the unit square there survives a Cantor set , invariant under
<I>T</I>, with repelling cycles. That is,  is a &quot;strange
repellor&quot;.

In 1981 Graciela Chichilnisky introduced the North-South model
of macroeconomic interaction between two regions. For a complete
treatment of this application, see Abraham, R. H., G. Chichilnisky,
R. J. Record, [1994] &quot;Dynamics of North-South Trade and the
Environment&quot; in <U>Environmental Economics</U>, Graciela
Chichilnisky, ed., Mattei Foundation, Milan (in press). In that
paper, a dynamical model is developed, based on the idea of slowly
changing the capital stock variable in the static model and assuming
a rapid approach to equilibrium. Capital accumulation through
time in each region is described by the equations :
<P>
 . 
<P>
That is, capital stock at time <I>t+1</I> is the sum of capital
stock at time<I> t</I> plus savings minus depreciation. The North-South
trade variables are as follows :
<P>
 <I>B </I>- basic goods
<P>
 <I>I </I>- industrial goods
<P>
 <I>K</I> - capital
<P>
 <I>L</I> - labor (later, labor is replaced by the environment,
E)
<P>
  - price of basic goods
<P>
  - price of industrial goods
<P>
 <I>p</I> - price of basic goods as set by the international terms
of trade after normalizing, =1
<P>
 <I>w</I> - price of labor (wages)
<P>
 <I>r </I>- rental of capital
<P>
  - property rights of a common resource property
<P>
 subscripts denote region (<I>N</I> or <I>S</I>)
<P>
 subscript <I>T</I> denotes total in both regions (e.g. )
<P>
 superscripts denote supply (<I>S</I>) and demand (<I>D</I>) (e.g.
 denotes demand for basic goods in the South)
<P>
In the dynamical model, the common resource property rights in
the South, , is varied. Additional parameters in the North-South
model are held fixed at experimentally determined values which
are chosen such that the variables <I>p, r, w, L, K, B, I</I>
&gt; 0 in each region. The fixed parameter values used are shown
in the following table.<HR>
