<B>4.1 Locating Bifurcations<!--4.1 Locating Bifurcations--></B>
<!--Bifurcationlocating-->
<P>
Often the first task in analyzing an endomorphism (or any map)
is locating critical parameter values at which bifurcations occur.
The use of <B>endo</B> can usually make this task much easier.
After having established the domain of iteration and applying
the classical dynamical systems tools such as calculation of the
eigenvalues at fixed points, endo can be employed to construct
a graphical display of the Lyapunov exponents and corresponding
bifurcations diagrams.
<P>
Use the menu of maps, command-line options, or interactive run-time
control to select the map and Lyapunov exponent mode. To view
bifurcation diagrams, also select the bifurcation diagram mode.
<B>Endo</B> will now construct a graphical display of the Lyapunov
exponents. To locate critical bifurcation values, zoom in on an
area of the graphical display which exhibits a sudden shift in
color (e.g. shades of blue next to shades of green or red). Use
the &quot;information&quot; window to determine the parameter
values being displayed. The &quot;information&quot; window can
be toggled by use of the &quot;I&quot; key. Continue zooming until
a small enough window is displaying the transition between negative
and positive Lyapunov exponents. Use values from these parameter
intervals to calculate and display attractors, basins of attraction,
critical and pre-critical curves, and absorbing areas.
<P>
<B>4.2 Displaying Bifurcation Diagrams<!--4.2 Displaying Bifurcation
Diagrams--></B><!--Bifurcationdiagrams-->
<P>
If you selected the bifurcation diagram mode as well, an additional
window displaying bifurcation diagrams is displayed. As the Lyapunov
exponents are being calculated, bifurcation diagrams are simultaneously
displayed. Several bifurcation diagram display modes are available.
By default, the bifurcation diagram window displays an attractor
in the selected region of the plane for each parameter value.
Alternate modes are selected by pressing the '2' key. The alternate
modes display the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, or x and y coordinates
of the trajectory on the attractor as the y-coordinate in the
bifurcation diagram and the parameter value as the x-coordinate
in the bifurcation diagram. If <B>endo</B> was compiled with the
3-D option, then an additional three dimensional mode is available.
This mode is selected with the '3' key and displays the bifurcation
diagram with one axis representing the parameter value and the
other two representing the x and y coordinates of the attractor
for that parameter value.
<P>
Each of the bifurcation diagram modes has an &quot;animation&quot;
mode<!--Animation mode--> that can be toggled with the 'e' key.
In animation mode, the bifurcation diagram window is cleared when
a new parameter value is selected. In this mode the window displays
a &quot;movie&quot; of the attractor as it changes with the changing
parameter values. Zooming in and out of the bifurcation diagram
window is also possible.
<P>
<B>4.3 Locating an Absorbing Area<!--4.3 Locating an Absorbing
Area--></B><!--Absorbing Arealocating-->
<P>
The procedure developed by Christian Mira for determining an absorbing
area (described in Chapter 5) is implemented as an algorithm in
<B>endo</B>. To display the boundary of an absorbing area with
<B>endo</B>, select the display of the critical curves window.
It is only necessary to iterate the map for a single iteration
in order to calculate the critical curve  an its iterate . To
do this, set the settle to 0 and the dwell to 1 (e.g. use the
command-line switches &quot;-S 0 -n 1 -P 1&quot;). After calculating
and displaying the critical curves, <B>endo</B> will highlight
the critical arc<!--Critical curvescritical arcs--> (if any) to
be iterated by displaying it in white. If there is no intersection
between  and , alternate domains of iteration may be tried.
<P>
After the critical curves are calculated and critical arc highlighted,
increase the dwell by pressing the '&gt;' key the desired number
of times (each time doubles the dwell count). Press 'g' to iterate
the critical arc. Each iteration of the critical arc will be displayed
in a different color. Increase or decrease the dwell as desired,
erase the critical curves window and redisplay critical curves
and iterates of the critical arc. If an additional arc was detected,
that arc can be selected by pressing 't'.

<B>4.4 Making a Movie<!--4.4 Making a Movie--></B><!--Movie-->
<P>
Once an &quot;interesting&quot; regime of parameter values is
located and bifurcation diagrams viewed, it is often desirable
to generate a sequence of &quot;frames&quot; for use in generating
a computer animation of the bifurcations. This is simplified through
the use of <B>endo</B>'s  &quot;demo&quot; mode<!--Demo mode-->.
When given the &quot;-0&quot; command-line option, <B>endo</B>
exits after completing the specified number of iterations and
optionally writing the contents of a window to a file. To generate
a sequence of files representing frames in an animated bifurcation
sequence, use the &quot;-0 -o filename -A parameter-value&quot;
command-line switches in conjunction with the shell scripting
capabilities of a UNIX shell. An example for use with the Bourne
shell (/bin/sh on most systems) is as follows :
