The study of discrete dynamical systems has been primarily limited
to maps of an interval of the line and/or diffeomorphisms<!--Diffeomorphism
-->. A rigorous theory of the dynamics of noninvertible maps of
the plane has only recently developed. Many of the analytical
techniques and theory applied to diffeomorphisms<!--Diffeomorphism
--> is either unavailable or limited in the context of two-dimensional
endomorphisms of the plane. The method of critical curves provides
researchers in this field with analytical and experimental tools.
This work presents research in the study of noninvertible maps
of the plane carried out by developing the method of critical
curves and incorporating this theory in experimental digital simulations.

The method of <I>critical curves</I><!--Critical curvesintroduction

systems in the plane defined by noninvertible endomorphisms<!--Endomorphismintroduction

analysis developed and used by the author and colleagues by presenting
the following :

<B>Endo</B> is a software laboratory designed for the analysis
of discrete dynamical systems in two dimensions. The user is provided
with several graphical representations of the dynamics including
the point trajectories<!--Trajectoryview-->, basins of attraction,
Lyapunov exponents, critical and precritical curves<!--Critical
curvesview-->, and bifurcation<!--Bifurcation--> diagrams. <B>Endo
</B> is designed to be highly interactive. Using the keyboard
and mouse, the user can select from a menu containing a wide variety
of maps, toggle analytical features, select specific areas for
closer examination and interactively explore the dynamical properties
of the planar endomorphism.
<P>
The name &quot;endo&quot; is short for &quot;endomorphism&quot;
<!--Endomorphismintroduction-->, a noninvertible smooth map. The
study of  the dynamics of these maps has generally been restricted
to one dimension. This software attempts to utilize current developments
in the theory of planar endomorphisms<!--Endomorphismintroduction
-->, especially the theory of critical curves<!--Critical curvesintroduction
--> and the role they can play in the dynamical analysis of such
maps. <B>Endo</B> is an <B>X11</B> graphical client written in
the <B>C</B> programming language. It has been compiled and run
on a wide variety of platforms including Intel, Mips, Motorola,
Sparc and RS6000 architectures.

<B>Context<!--Context--></B><!--Context-->

Dynamical systems theory has concerned itself with both continuous
and discrete systems. In the case of continuous systems, the theory
of <I>flows</I><B> </B><!--Flow-->is the study of actions of the
real line on a manifold, generated by a vector field. The study
of <I>cascades</I><B> </B><!--Cascade-->arose naturally from the
study of flows when, at the turn of the century, Henri Poincar&eacute;
<!--Poincar&eacute;--> used the <I>return map</I> <!--Return map
-->of a cross-section of a flow. Cascades<!--Cascade--> are actions
of the integers on a manifold, generated by a diffeomorphism<!--Diffeomorphism
-->. The theories of flows and cascades<!--Cascade-->, initiated
by Poincar&eacute;<!--Poincar&eacute;-->, has enjoyed a century
of rich exploration and development. 
<P>
The third area of dynamical systems theory, that of <I>semi-cascades
</I><!--Semi-cascade-->,<I> </I>are actions of the non-negative
integers generated by a noninvertible endomorphism<!--Endomorphismsemi-cascade
-->. The research presented in this paper concerns itself with
the iteration of planar endomorphisms which are noninvertible.
Many of these noninvertible endomorphisms arose in the study of
population biology, ecology, economic systems and other natural
phenomena. An example from the field of population dynamics is
the density dependent Leslie matrix of Guckenheimer, Oster and
Ipaktchi who explored the map . These efforts were an attempt
to model predator-prey and host-parasitoid interaction. In these
simple population biology models the iteration usually represented
a strobed census of the population, typically at annual or generation
length intervals.
<P>
 Iterated maps of the Complex plane as investigated by the pioneering
French school of Poincar&eacute;, Picard, Montel, Fatou and Julia
can also be thought of as iterated maps of the Real plane by a
suitable transformation of coordinates. For instance, the function
used in the calculation of the Mandelbrot set is  where z  is
a  Complex variable and c is a  Complex parameter. Letting  and
, the map is transformed into a map of  the Real plane into itself
defined by , a function of two Real variables, x and y, and two
Real parameters, a and b.
<P>
Often a physical or biological system will be modelled by a system
of partial differential equations. The process of numerically
investigating theses systems usually involves transforming the
partial differential equations into ordinary differential equations
and, in the nonlinear case, numerically integrating these using
one of several popular techniques, all of which involve a discrete
time increment. Thus, many mathematical models comprised of partial
differential equations eventually are transformed into the discrete
time and space domain of numerically integrated ordinary nonlinear
differential equations. An excellent treatment of this phenomena
is presented by Lorenz in 1989 in an investigation of  chaotic
behavior induced by using difference equations as approximations
to ODE's solved numerically with a large time increment .

<B>History<!--History--></B><!--History-->
<P>
Perhaps the most widely known use of iterated maps in the analysis
of dynamical systems is the Poincar&eacute; return map. Henri
Poincar&eacute; reduced the study of an autonomous differential
equation of the 2nd order to the study of a transformation of
the line into itself by interpreting the second order differential
equation as a 1st order dynamical system in the plane and drawing
a section across its trajectories. He also considered a transformation
of a circle into itself defined by trajectories on a torus and
their section. Poincar&eacute; generalized this method to dynamical
systems in three dimensions where the reduced section is a surface
and the return map a transformation of the plane into itself.
The restricted problem of three bodies, reduced to three dimensions,
was further reduced to a planar endomorphism by Poincar&eacute;.
Investigating the invariant curves passing through a saddle point
of a planar endomorphism, Henri Poincar&eacute; discovered the
existence of homoclinic and heteroclinic (doubly-asymptotic) points.
He described the figure obtained as an inextricable tangle of
curves.
<P>
Examples of the use of iterated maps (or recurrence relations)
throughout the history of mathematics abound. The Fibonacci sequence,
Newton's method and the Naperian logarithm can or have been defined
as recurrence relations. Fibonacci's sequence can be defined by
the recurrence relation  with the initial conditions . Viewed
as a map of the plane, it becomes  which has a unique fixed point
at the origin. Calculating the eigenvalues, we see that  implies
that  or , the Golden Mean and the opposite of its inverse. 
<P>
Newton's method for finding the roots of  involves the iteration
of the recurrence relation . Hurwitz defined the Naperian logarithm
of a number  by means of the recurrence relation  with solution
. Thus, .
<P>
 The theory of semi-cascades<!--Semi-cascade--> is more recent
than that of flows and cascades<!--Cascade--> and has mainly been
studied for maps of the line.  A rigorous study in two dimensions
dates only from the 1960s.  In 1964 Christian Mira<!--Mira-->
introduced the method of critical curves<!--Critical curveshistory
-->. One of the distinguishing features of a noninvertible endomorphism
<!--Endomorphismcritical curves--> is the existence of these curves.
The geometric theory of semi-cascades<!--Semi-cascade-->, as developed
by Mira<!--Mira--> and his school, relies heavily on the analysis
of the critical curves<!--Critical curveshistory-->.
