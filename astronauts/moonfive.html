<br>
<br>
To commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing on July 20, 1969, The "Oprah Winfrey" show invited five Apollo astronauts into an open-studio forum to talk about their moon experiences, both during the mission and afterwards. What they had to say about their missions, UFOs and extraterrestrials in general is worth repeating, particularly in light of the  many "stories" attributed to the Apollo astronauts.

<h3>The astronauts taking part were:</h3>

<tr valign=top><td><b>Oprah:</b></td><td>Ed, did going to the moon increase your feelings about psychic phenomena ?</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Mitchell:</b></td><td>Mmmm, no, not really.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Oprah:</b></td><td>No, you always believed it...</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Mitchell:</b></td><td>Put it into different terms.  Those are old, old words, by the way.  Let's use the word "intuition..."</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Oprah:</b></td><td>Okay.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Mitchell:</b></td><td>...And how does information flow.  And yeah, I became very interested in that at that point.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Oprah:</b></td><td>Yeah.  I'm an intuitive-based person.  I do everything based on intuition.  Do you too ?</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Mitchell:</b></td><td>No. I'm a more linear thinker, I've had to develop the intuition...</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Oprah:</b></td><td>Not me, I don't go for the linear too much...</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Mitchell:</b></td><td>(laughs) ...It's to learn  how to get the balance, to get both of them; but the point of the investigations of the things I've been interested in; we know how our five senses work, but you're an intuitive person, most everybody's intuitive to a greater or lesser extent.  Where does that information come from ?  Where does intuitive information come from ?</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Oprah:</b></td><td>Uh-huh.  Where do you think it comes from ?</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Mitchell:</b></td><td>Well, we're starting to understand some "models" for it.  Jung called it the "collective unconscious", there's      information out here.  It's kind of like a field and we just kind of tune into it and there it is.  At least that is what the modern thinking is.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Oprah:</b></td><td>When you were "out there", did you sense that there were other "beings" -- not necessarily human -- also "out there" ? James... ?</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Irwin:</b></td><td>I never sensed anything out at the moon or even beyond the moon. I don't know (why) I get that question a lot,  because they think now  we're experts on extra-terrestrial life, but I say I don't think there's extra-terrestrial life anywhere.  I think the Earth is the only place where there's life.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Oprah:</b></td><td>You still think that ?</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Irwin:</b></td><td>I still believe that.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Oprah:</b></td><td>You all think that ?</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Mitchell:</b></td><td>No, I disagree completely.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Oprah:</b></td><td>You don't think that, Ed.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Mitchell:</b></td><td>No, I think  the universe is so magnificent and so huge, and, uh, there is an intelligence base in the universe. And I can't conceive of this being the only planet in the universe with intelligent life...</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Oprah:</b></td><td>Intelligent life...</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Mitchell:</b></td><td>...I think that there's intelligent life throughout the universe, we just haven't discovered it yet.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Oprah:</b></td><td>My intuition tells me that, too, Ed.  Buzz, what do you say ? </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Aldrin:</b></td><td>Ed may feel a little bit more certain about that.  I'm not sure what's going to happen. It certainly looks as though the odds are that there are a lot more opportunites out there than we thought before, and I'd be very surprised -- and it may even happen in our life time -- that we may find out some evidence of intelligence and it will come because of a furthering of the space program.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Oprah:</b></td><td>All right.  Alan.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Bean:</b></td><td>Well I think there's probably life out there. But someone said, or computed, that the number of bodies in the universe  are about as dense as two chipmunks in all of North America. And so for us to go and find --  let's say we're one of the chipmunks and we're trying to find one of the others in all of North America -- it's going to be hard to do.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Aldrin:</b></td><td>Tough job...</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Bean:</b></td><td>So, I believe they're out there too, but we're not going to find them any time soon, and we may never find them, because of just the fact that they're so far, far apart.  If we look at all the stars out there, there's probably planets around them, but which one do we go to ?  And if we go to that one, even the nearest one takes four and a half years, come back in nine...</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Aldrin:</b></td><td>At the speed of light...</td></tr>      
<tr valign=top><td><b>Bean:</b></td><td>That's right. Then go to the next one, takes another fifty years, out and back...  </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Oprah:</b></td><td>Yeah, I'm not THAT interested...</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Bean:</b></td><td>So it's going to be a tough job...</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Oprah:</b></td><td>...I've got things to do here.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Bean:</b></td><td>...It'd be better if they came here.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Aldrin:</b></td><td>Yeah, it'd be better if they came here.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Oprah:</b></td><td>That's how I feel about it. Charles ?</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Duke:</b></td><td>I didn't sense any life out in space, personally.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Oprah:</b></td><td>Never saw anybody..?</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Duke:</b></td><td>Never saw anybody, no UFOs, nothing like that. But I agree with Jim.  I think that we are -- human life -- is unique in the universe, and I think that's here on Earth. I believe in spiritual life.  The scripture does talk about Heaven and Hell and spiritual life, life after death, but it doesn't refer to anything out in space.  So I agree with Jim.</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Audience:</b></td><td>Um yes. Do you feel that the Government hides anything from us ?  For example, you see all these stories about people that say they've been abducted and raped -- women that've been raped -- and they say that it's a real factual story and that tons of people have seen it...</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Oprah:</b></td><td>By ETs ?  What paper was this is in ?</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Audience:</b></td><td>Did you see that show (where) they said the lights were coming down and the police were out watching...?  Do you think that the Government hides any of that ?</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Duke:</b></td><td>No, I don't.  Not in NASA.  We were completely open.  We couldn't even have a private conversation without it being blasted out to the world.  I remember John (Young) and I were talking and we had a problem with, uh, our microphone stuck open and he was cussing and it went out to everybody.  No bleeps !</td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Oprah:</b></td><td>Ed, what do you say, you're shaking your head ? </td></tr>
<tr valign=top><td><b>Mitchell:</b></td><td>Well, I agree with what Charlie is saying about the NASA program  -- there was nothing at all hidden in that -- but I do believe that there's a lot more known about, uh, extra-terrestrial investigation than is available to the public right now; has been for a long time.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Oprah:</b></td><td>And why do you think it's kept from the public ?</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Mitchell:</b></td><td>Oh well, that's a long, long story. It goes back to World War 2 when all of that happened, and highly classified stuff.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Aldrin:</b></td><td>It makes for great book-selling...</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Mitchell:</b></td><td>Yeah...</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Irwin:</b></td><td>And newspapers, too. </td></tr>
