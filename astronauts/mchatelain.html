<h3>Critical Note:</h3>
"when James Oberg contacted Chatelain's employers he learned that Chatelain was no longer employed by them when Apollo 11 landed on the moon.  If he was no longer an employee of a NASA sub-contractor then he could not have been present in any so-called "secret room" where he could overhear the confidential communications of
the astronauts on the lunar surface. He was a low-level engineer who worked for a NASA sub-contractor who built the Apollo communications systems.  His status as the "head of communications" (as some UFOlogists have claimed), is entirely false." <BR>

In 1979 Maurice Chatelain, confirmed that Armstrong had indeed reported seeing two UFOs on the rim of a crater. Chatelain believes that some UFOs may come from our own solar system -- specifically Titan. <BR>
<BR>
"The encounter was common knowledge in NASA, but nobody has talked about it until now." <BR>
<BR>
"...all Apollo and Gemini flights were followed, both at a distance and sometimes also quite closely,
by space vehicles of extraterrestrial origin - flying saucers, or UFOs, if you want to call them by that
name. Every time it occurred, the astronauts informed Mission Control, who then ordered absolute
silence." <BR>
<BR>
"I think that Walter Schirra aboard Mercury 8 was the first of the astronauts to use the code name
'Santa Claus' to indicate the presence of flying saucers next to space capsules. However, his
announcements were barely noticed by the general public. It was a little different when James Lovell
on board the Apollo 8 command module came out from behind the moon and said for everybody to
hear: 'PLEASE BE INFORMED THERE IS A SANTA CLAUS.' Even though this
happened on Christmas Day 1968, many people sensed a hidden meaning in those words." <BR>
<BR>
The rumors persist. NASA may well be a civilian agency, but many of its programs are funded by
the defence budget and most of the astronauts are subject to military security regulations. Apart from
the fact that the National Security Agency screens all films and probably radio communications as
well. We have the statements by Otto Binder, Dr. Garry Henderson and Maurice Chatelain that the
astronauts were under strict orders not to discuss their sightings. And Gordon Cooper has testified
to a United Nations committee that one of the astronauts actually witnessed a UFO on the ground. If
there is no secrecy, why has this sighting not been made public ?
