If you were on a mission to study the inhabitants of the planet we call earth would you not be interested in the primitive attempts at early space travel. It seems that UFO's have been especially interested in following our space program. Just what do our astronauts know that they aren't talking about ? What did we find when we went to the moon ? The astronauts that returned from the moon seemed to be profoundly changed by the experience. Why did we seemingly abandon our space program following the lunar landings ? Is the answer a lack of interest ?  Congress would'nt fund the space program because they perceive a lack of interest and support from the tax-paying voters. The United States used to be the world's largest launcher of commercial satellites but with successive cuts in NASA's funding, disposable launch vehicles stopped being built. Now countries like China, France, and Russia are the main sources for putting satellites into orbit.  But why did the Russians not even attempt to go to the moon ? Was being second so bad ? These are all profound questions which I cannot attempt to answer. But let's examine the evidence that has been collected and then each come to our own conclusions.<br>

Donald Slayton a Mercury astronaut revealed in an interview he had seen UFOs in 1951: <br>
"I was testing a P-51 fighter in Minneapolis when I spotted this object. I was at about 10,000 feet
on a nice, bright, sunny afternoon. I thought the object was a kite, then I realized that no kite is
gonna fly that high." <BR>
<BR>
As I got closer it looked like a weather balloon, gray and about three feet in diameter. But as soon
as I got behind the darn thing it didn't look like a balloon anymore. It looked like a saucer, a disk. <BR>
<BR>
About the same time, I realized that it was suddenly going away from me -- and there I was, running
at about 300 miles per hour. I tracked it for a little way, and then all of a sudden the damn thing just
took off. It pulled about a 45 degree climbing turn and accelerated and just flat disappeared." <BR clear=all>

On July 17, 1962 Major Robert White reported a UFO during his fifty-eight-mile high flight of an
X-15. Major White reported: "I have no idea what it could be. It was grayish in color and about thrity to forty feet away." 
<BR>
<BR>
Then according to a Time Magazine article, Major White exclaimed over the radio: "There ARE things out there! There absolutely is!"<br>

On May 11, 1962 NASA pilot Joseph Walker said that one of his tasks was to detect UFOs during
his X-15 flights. He had filmed five or six UFOs during his record breaking fifty-mile-high flight in
April, 1962. It was the second time he had filmed UFOs in flight. During a lecture at the Second
National Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Space Research in Seattle, Washington he said: <BR>
<BR>
"I don't feel like speculating about them. All I know is what appeared on the film which was
developed after the flight." - Joseph Walker <BR>
<BR>
To date none of those films has been released to the public for viewing. <BR>

It is reported that the capsule of Gemini IX  June 3, 1966  (Stafford, Cernan) was accompanied from takeoff by UFO's seen from the ground as well as the capsule. During the flight of Apollo 10, May 1969 (Thomas P. Stafford, John W. Young, Eugene E. Cernan), UFO's were reportedly spotted during orbit around the moon and on the homeward bound flight.<br>
Eugene Cernan was commander of Apollo 17 ( Cernan, Evans, Schmitt, Reported to have been accompanied by UFO's near earth, on route and around the moon..) In a Los Angeles Times article in 1973 Cernand said, about UFOs: <BR>
<BR>
"...I've been asked (about UFOs) and I've said publicly I thought they (UFOs) were somebody else,
some other civilization." <BR clear=all>

"At no time, when the astronauts were in space were they alone: there was a constant surveillance by
UFOs." <br>

<h2>Space Shuttle Discovery</h2>
<h3>March 1989 03/14/89 6:42 EST</h3>
</center>
<br>
<br>
"Uh Houston, this is Discovery. We still have the alien spacecraft under (observance)????"  (note last word difficult to make out on tape)<br>
<br>
The previous statement was recorded by Baltimore resident Donald Ratsch (MUFON member) from a HAM radio rebroadcast between the space shuttle Discovery and Houston ground control. The HAM broadcast was direct from the shuttle without going through the delayed filter used on the officail NASA public feed. The NASA select audio channel did not contain this one way broadcast from the shuttle to ground control. The HAM station making the rebroadcast was WA3NAN Goddard Amatuer Radio Club in Greenbelt, MD transmitting on 147.450 MHZ. Preliminary analysis shows that the voice could be either Michael Coats (Commander) or John E. Blaha (pilot). The recording was sent for further expert voice analysis the results of which are unknown at this time.<br>
