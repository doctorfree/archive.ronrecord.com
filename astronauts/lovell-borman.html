In December 1965, Gemini VII astronauts James Lovell and Frank Borman also saw a UFO during their
second orbit of their record-breaking 14 day flight. Borman reported that he saw an unidentified
spacecraft some distance from their capsule. Gemini Control, at Cape Kennedy told him that he was
seeing the final stage of their own Titan booster rocket. Borman confirmed that he could see the
booster rocket all right, but that he could also see something completely different.

Lovell is reported to have taken some magnificent photographs of two mushroom shaped UFO's on December 4. The pictures seem to show the glow of a propulsion system on the underside. The pictures were taken at a range of several hundred yards. Some believe this picture to be a blatant forgery accomplished by airbrushing a picture of light reflecting off the nose of the spacecraft.<br>

Lovell also witnessed an incident during flight Gemini XII (James Lovell, Edwin Aldrin): On November 12 both astronauts are reported to have spotted 2 UFO's approximately 1/2 mile from the spacecraft. They were observed for some period of time and photographs were taken.<br>

During the flight of Apollo 8 on Dec. 1968  (Frank Borman, James A. Lovell, William A. Anders) as the command module emerged from behind the moon Lovell transmits "Please be informed there is a Santa Claus". As this occurred on christmas day 1968 it is deemed by many to have been Lovell's sense of humor for the kiddies watching the broadcast. Some speculate that it is the use of the code word originally employed by Walter Schirra on the Mercury 8 flight. On Christmas eve Borman and Lovell are reported to have seen a UFO. It is reported that an unidentified language was picked up on one of the NASA frequencies used during the mission.
