    Well, when i left work last night, on my screen was Netscape
    Navigator displaying Timothy Leary's Home Page with a Health
    Update. That evening at the Red Room, i happened to mention
    to Steve that Ireland spelled backwards is DNA Leri and that
    Leary had written a book called "The Intelligence Agents" in
    which he portrayed himself as Agent Leri of DNA.
  <P>
    Last night while drifting off to sleep in my usual Thursday
    night Drunken Psionic Trance, i tried to recall just exactly
    when it was that Dr. Leary had come to my home in Family Student
    Housing at UCSC. It was his 63rd birthday and a student group
    i had formed (S^3 - The Student S.M.I.L.E. Society) had sponsored
    a talk by Leary that night in the dining hall at College 5.
  <P>
    Anyway, i'm laying there trying to figure out how old Leary is
    and i start imagining i am talking to him and i'm telling him
    how i think it's ok to donate his brain to cryogenic research
    but that it was just a research project and if he was interested
    in living forever he should look no further than his remarkable
    books. That he had, in fact, transmitted his DNA intelligence and
    wisdom in an excellently coded linguistic art form. That he was
    basically already immortal and he needn't worry about his body
    or brain decomposing.
  <P>
    This morning i got a call from Jodi informing me that Timothy
    Leary's dead. No, no, no, no ... he's outside looking in.

    <B>Update</B>: I just discovered that the Oct 22, 1983 UCSC Leary talk that S^3
    organized is available as a podcast in iTunes! If you go to the iTunes store and
    search for "322-Leary" it is the podcast of his talk titled "The Evolution of
    Intelligence".
