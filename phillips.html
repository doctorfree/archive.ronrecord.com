  Ronnie graduated from
  <A HREF="http://www.phillips.edu">Phillips University</A>
  in 1973 with a B.A. in
  Political Science. He actually had enough hours to qualify for the B.S.
  in Mathematics but for some reason chose Poly Sci. Go figure.
  <P>
    Phillips University suspended classes, filed for bankruptcy and padlocked
    its doors in the Summer of 1998. Some facts about
    <A HREF="http://www.phillips.edu/puhist.htm">Phillips University</A>:
  <UL>
    <LI>A private, coeducational university founded in
      <A HREF=enid.html>Enid, Oklahoma</A>,
      in 1906 by the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).
    <LI>Accredited since 1919, longer than any other private school in Oklahoma.
    <LI>Rated among the top 10 liberal arts colleges in the region three times
      in the past six years by U.S. News & World Report.
    <LI>Student/faculty ratio is 13:1

  </UL>
  <P>
    Ronnie can still sing the
    <A HREF=almamater.html>Phillips University Alma Mater</A>.

    While at PU, Saint Reginald was required
    to study Our Christian Heritage and Biblical Literature. This came in
    real handy when, later, Ronald decided to read Faulkner.
  <P>
    The townsfolk of
    <A HREF="enid.html">
      Enid, Oklahoma</A>
    (where Phillips is located) all thought the
    Professors were a bunch of atheists and they referred to the students as
    choir boys. When a bunch of us "choir boys" marched on the Garfield County
    Courthouse in support of the Vietnam War Moratorium, we were pelted with
    beer cans from the back of pickup trucks. All in all, i received a splendid
    education at Phillips.

    Another graduate of
    <A HREF="http://www.phillips.edu">Phillips University</A>

    Ronnie and Jim worked together in the
    <A HREF="http://www.phillips.edu">Phillips University</A>
    Computer Center
    (or was it called the Data Processing Center ?). Anyway, Jim pointed out
    to Ronnie that there is a site for
    <A HREF="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ken_crossman/phillips.htm">
      e-mail addresses of former PU students</A>.
